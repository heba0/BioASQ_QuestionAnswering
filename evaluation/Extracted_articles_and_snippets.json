                    "text": "Herpesvirus genomes are maintained as extrachromosomal plasmids within the nuclei of infected cells. Some herpesviruses persist within dividing cells, putting the viral genome at risk of being lost to the cytoplasm during mitosis because karyokinesis (nuclear division) requires nuclear envelope breakdown. Oncogenic herpesviruses (and papillomaviruses) avoid genome loss during mitosis by tethering their genomes to cellular chromosomes, thereby ensuring viral genome uptake into newly formed nuclei. These viruses use viral proteins with DNA- and chromatin-binding capabilities to physically link viral and cellular genomes together in a process called tethering. The known viral tethering proteins of human papillomavirus (E2), Epstein-Barr virus (EBNA1), and Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (LANA) each contain two independent domains required for genome tethering, one that binds sequence specifically to the viral genome and another that binds to cellular chromatin. This latter domain is called a chromatin tethering domain (CTD). The human cytomegalovirus UL123 gene encodes a CTD that is required for the virus to productively infect dividing fibroblast cells within the S phase of the cell cycle, presumably by tethering the viral genome to cellular chromosomes during mitosis. The CTD-containing UL123 gene product that supports S-phase infections is the IE19 protein. Here, we define two motifs in IE19 required for S-phase infections: an N-terminal triple lysine motif and a C-terminal nucleosome-binding motif within the CTD.IMPORTANCEThe IE19 protein encoded by human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is required for S-phase infection of dividing cells, likely because it tethers the viral genome to cellular chromosomes, thereby allowing them to survive mitosis. The mechanism through which IE19 tethers viral genomes to cellular chromosomes is not understood. For human papillomavirus, Epstein-Barr virus, and Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus, viral genome tethering is required for persistence (latency) and pathogenesis (oncogenesis). Like these viruses, HCMV also achieves latency, and it modulates the properties of glioblastoma multiforme tumors. Therefore, defining the mechanism through which IE19 tethers viral genomes to cellular chromosomes may help us understand, and ultimately combat or control, HCMV latency and oncomodulation."

Major risk factors include peculiar chewing habits, human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and molecular pathways. However, less data is available for this avertible cancer regarding its association with high-risk HPV (HR-HPV) and chewing habits in this region. Therefore, this study was done to determine the prevalence of HR-HPV in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) and its correlation with p16 and chewing habits. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) biopsy specimens of 186 samples were tested for HR-HPV type 16/18 by PCR, followed by p16 immunostaining (IHC) in a subset of cases (n = 50). Appropriate statistical tests were applied to find the association between HR-HPV/p16 and peculiar chewing habits with significance criteria of p<0.05 with 95% CI. HR-HPV (type 16 &18) was present in seven out of 186 cases (3.8%). Of these seven cases, five were positive for HPV16, whereas two were positive for HPV16/18. The overall expression of p16 protein in 50 samples was 38% (n = 19), and among these 19-IHC positive samples, 26% were positive for HR-HPV DNA. No significant association was found between HR-HPV positivity and p16 and chewing habits (p>0.05). It was concluded that HR-HPV prevalence in OSCC was very low in our population, with no statistically significant correlation with p16 and chewing habits. These results suggest the role of HR-HPV as an independent risk factor in OSCC in the local setting."

High-resolution anoscopy (HRA) is an in-clinic procedure to detect precancerous anal lesions and cancer, yet prospective data on factors associated with HRA attendance are lacking. We examined whether anal HPV sampling at home versus in a clinic impacts HRA uptake and assessed HRA acceptability. Methods Sexual and gender minority individuals were randomised to home-based self-sampling or clinical sampling. All were asked to attend in-clinic HRA 1year later. We regressed HRA attendance on study arm using multivariable Poisson regression and assessed HRA acceptability using \u03c7 2 tests. Results A total of 62.8% of 196 participants who engaged in screening attended HRA. Although not significant (P =0.13), a higher proportion of participants who engaged in clinic-based screening attended HRA (68.5%) compared to home-based participants (57.9%). Overall, HRA uptake was higher among participants with anal cytology history (aRR 1.40, 95% CI 1.07-1.82), and lower among participants preferring a versatile anal sex position versus insertive (aRR 0.70, 95% CI 0.53-0.91), but did not differ by race or HIV serostatus. In the clinic arm, persons living with HIV had lower HRA attendance (42.9%) versus HIV-negative participants (73.3%) (P =0.02) and Black non-Hispanic participants had lower HRA attendance (41.7%) than White non-Hispanic participants (73.1%), (P =0.04). No differences in attendance by race or HIV status were observed in the home arm. Conclusions HRA uptake differed significantly by race and HIV status in the clinic arm but not the home arm."

In recent years, with a better understanding of the effectiveness and safety of vaccinations, many recommendations have been developed for administering vaccines to adults. Countless physiological changes occur during pregnancy, including those affecting the immune system. Pregnant women are at increased risk of developing infections and resulting complications. According to research, vaccines are immunogenic and safe for pregnant women. Pregnancy is not an absolute contraindication to vaccination. After administration of vaccines to pregnant women, the concentration of antibodies increases, which can be transferred to the child in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy and provide protection in the first months of life. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), guidelines of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology (ACOG) unanimously recommend vaccination of pregnant women if a safe vaccine is available and there is a risk of exposure of the woman to a disease that threatens herself or her developing baby. In everyday clinical practice, medical professionals should provide their patients with the necessary information on vaccinations, which may contribute to greater awareness and implementation of vaccinations. This article aims to review current global recommendations for the vaccination of pregnant and breastfeeding women, including against the Omicron variants of SARS-CoV-2."

                    "text": "Border disease virus (BDV) is a member of the pestivirus genus that primarily affects sheep, causing reproductive losses through abortion, still births and the birth of weak lambs. The key characteristic of this disease is the birth of persistently infected (PI) lambs which, after surviving transplacental infection, are born antibody negative, yet virus positive, and thus shed the virus for their entire life and are the primary source of spread within a flock. The cornerstones of BDV control are detection and elimination of PI animals, biosecurity measures to prevent re-infection, and surveillance programs. Recommendations for the control of BDV in sheep are centred around the approach to bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV), the prominent cattle pestivirus species, due to a lack of specific research into BDV control and elimination. In this study, two aspects of a BDV control program were investigated: the effectiveness of the BVDV vaccine, Pestigard\u00ae, and the rate of seroconversion in a flock deliberately exposed to known PI lambs. The vaccine appeared to be safe, and the optimal dose was the full cattle dose (2\u2009mL). While vaccination induced high virus neutralising titres to BVDV when administered as either a quarter, half or full dose registered for cattle, the BDV titres achieved were low and unlikely to prevent transplacental infection. In a second study, after exposure of between 2 and 15\u2009days exposure to two PI lambs in confined conditions, only 3 of 66 previously na\u00efve sheep demonstrated seroconversion. This demonstrated a very low rate of transmission and suggested that deliberate exposure to PI lambs at low-risk times for less than 15\u2009days was not likely to be an effective means of achieving seroconversion throughout a flock and, therefore, not provide protection against BDV challenge during gestation."

Vaccination can reduce the burden of RSV-related respiratory disease, with previous studies showing its substantial medical and financial burden in Jordan. However, pregnant women may exhibit hesitancy to get vaccinated due to concerns about potential risks to themselves or their fetuses. This study aimed to assess the acceptance of the RSV vaccine among young females and identify the determinants influencing their decision using a newly constructed instrument. A survey instrument was developed and validated, comprising 26 items to measure RSV vaccine acceptance. A cross-sectional study design was employed, with data collection from a sample of females aged 18 to 45 residing in Jordan during 5-6 July 2023, using a convenient approach via an online distributed questionnaire. The final study sample comprised 315 respondents, with 67.6% who have heard of RSV before the study. If the vaccine was safe, effective, and provided freely, 70.2% showed willingness to get the RSV vaccine, 15.2% resisted, and 14.6% were hesitant. Principal component analysis identified six internally consistent sub-scales with the following suggested themes: Advice, Burden, Conspiracy, Dangers, Efficiency, and Fear, comprising 21 items collectively as assigned as the \"ABCDEF\" scale for RSV vaccine acceptance. RSV vaccine acceptance in this study was associated with the advice and fear constructs. The validated survey instrument successfully captured important determinants of RSV vaccine acceptance among young females. RSV vaccine promotion efforts should focus on the following: enhancing vaccine education, improving trust in healthcare institutions and providers, reducing burdens through resolving cost issues and focusing on the role of social support, addressing safety concerns, and tailoring communication strategies to effectively promote the benefits of the vaccine. These insights can inform public health policies and interventions aiming to promote RSV vaccination and mitigate the burden of RSV-related diseases among infants. Follow-up studies are recommended with pregnant women as the target group to assess their attitude towards RSV vaccination and to confirm the validity of the conceived ABCDEF survey instrument."

Water buffaloes were vaccinated with the vaccine RB51. A booster vaccination was administered at 12 months of age. When turning 23-25 months old, female animals were induced to pregnancy. RB51-specific antibodies were detected and quantified using a CFT based on the RB51 antigen. Vaccinated animals showed a positive serological reaction following each vaccine injection, but titers and the duration of the antibody differed among animals. For 36 weeks after booster vaccination, the comparison of CFT values between vaccinated and control groups remained constantly significant. Afterwards, antibody titers decreased. No relevant changes in antibody response were recorded during pregnancy or lactation. In conclusion, results indicated that the vaccination schedule applied is safe and allows for vaccinated and unvaccinated controls to be discriminated between for up to 8 months after booster vaccination."

The prevailing Th2 profile in advanced CTCL underscores the significance of understanding IL-4/IL-13 expression dynamics from the early stages of disease, as a shift from Th1 to Th2 may explain CTCL progression. Targeted agents blocking key cytokines of type 2 immunity are established therapeutics in atopic disorders and have a promising therapeutic potential in CTCL, given their involvement in cutaneous symptoms and their contribution to the pathogenesis of disease. IL-4, IL-13, and IL-31 are implicated in pruritus, offering therapeutic targets with dupilumab, tralokinumab, lebrikizumab, and nemolizumab. This review analyzes current knowledge on the IL-4/IL-13 axis in mycosis fungoides and Sezary syndrome, the most common types of CTCL, examining existing literature on the pathogenetic implications with a focus on investigational treatments. Clinical trials and case reports are required to shed light on novel uses of medications in various diseases, and ongoing research into the role of IL-4/IL-13 axis blockers in CTCL therapy might not only improve the management of disease-related pruritus but also provide in-depth insights on the pathophysiologic mechanisms of CTCL."

Fewer than 20% of patients only survive beyond five years from diagnosis. CRC is a highly preventable disease if diagnosed at the early stage of malignancy. Several screening methods like endoscopy (like colonoscopy; gold standard), imaging examination [computed tomographic colonography (CTC)], guaiac-based fecal occult blood (gFOBT), immunochemical test from faeces, and stool DNA test are available with different levels of sensitivity and specificity. The available screening methods are associated with certain drawbacks like invasiveness, cost, or sensitivity. In recent years, computer-aided systems-based screening, diagnosis, and treatment have been very promising in the early-stage detection and diagnosis of CRC cases. Artificial intelligence (AI) is an enormously in-demand, cost-effective technology, that uses various tools machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) to screen, diagnose, and stage, and has great potential to treat CRC. Moreover, different ML algorithms and neural networks [artificial neural network (ANN), k-nearest neighbors (KNN), and support vector machines (SVMs)] have been deployed to predict precise and personalized treatment options. This review examines and summarizes different ML and DL models used for therapeutic intervention in CRC cancer along with the gap and challenges for AI."

CT colonography uses minimally invasive evaluation of colorectum and has better patient acceptance, which appears to be a promising screening modality to improve low colorectal cancer screening rate. This study investigated the utilization patterns of CT colonography and factors associated with its use among U.S. adult population. This retrospective cross-sectional study analyzed the National Health Interview Survey 2015 and 2018. U.S. adults ages 45 or older without a history of colorectal cancer were included. Survey design-adjusted Wald F tests were used to compare the utilization of CT colonography during the study period. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify the predictors of CT colonography among individual socioeconomic and health-related characteristics. The study sample included 34,768 individuals representing 129,430,319 U.S. adult population ages 45 or older. The overall utilization of CT colonography increased from 0.79% in 2015 to 1.33% in 2018 (<i>P</i> < 0.001). 54.5% study participants reported being up-to-date on recommended colorectal cancer screening; of those, 1.8% used CT colonography. Compared with individuals ages 65+, those ages 45-49 years were 2.08 times (OR, 2.08, 95% confidence interval, 1.01-4.35) more likely to use CT colonography. Socioeconomically disadvantaged characteristics (e.g., racial/ethnic minority, low income, publicly funded insurance) were associated with a greater likelihood of CT colonography. This study demonstrated an increasing trend in utilization of CT colonography for colorectal cancer screening in U.S. adults. Younger individuals, racial/ethnic minorities, or those with lower income appear to have a higher CT colonography utilization. PREVENTION RELEVANCE: Although computed tomographic (CT) colonography has been proved to be cost-effective and have better patient acceptance, its overall utilization for colorectal cancer (CRC) screening is low (<1.4%) among US adults aged 45+ in 2018. More efforts are needed to implement strategies to increase CT colonography for effective CRC prevention."

Materials and Methods Observed participation rates and screening costs from the Colonoscopy or Colonography for Screening, or COCOS, trial were used in a microsimulation model to estimate costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained with colonoscopy and CT colonography screening. For both tests, the authors determined optimal age range and screening interval combinations assuming a 100% participation rate. Assuming observed participation for these combinations, the cost-effectiveness of both tests was compared. Extracolonic findings were not included because long-term follow-up data are lacking. Results The participation rates for colonoscopy and CT colonography were 21.5% (1276 of 5924 invitees) and 33.6% (982 of 2920 invitees), respectively. Colonoscopy was more cost-effective in the screening strategies with one or two lifetime screenings, whereas CT colonography was more cost-effective in strategies with more lifetime screenings. CT colonography was the preferred test for willingness-to-pay-thresholds of \u20ac3200 per QALY gained and higher, which is lower than the Dutch willingness-to-pay threshold of \u20ac20 000. With equal participation, colonoscopy was the preferred test independent of willingness-to-pay thresholds. The findings were robust for most of the sensitivity analyses, except with regard to relative screening costs and subsequent participation. Conclusion Because of the higher participation rates, CT colonography screening for colorectal cancer is more cost-effective than colonoscopy screening. The implementation of CT colonography screening requires previous satisfactory resolution to the question as to how best to deal with extracolonic findings. <sup>\u00a9</sup> RSNA, 2018 Online supplemental material is available for this article."

While the role of CTC as a primary test for population screening of CRC is under investigation, the fecal occult blood test (FOBT) has been recommended for population screening of CRC in Europe. Subjects with positive FOBT are invited to undergo total colonoscopy, which has some critical issues, such as suboptimal compliance, contraindications and the possibility of an incomplete exploration of the colon. Based on available data, the integration of CTC in FOBT-based population screening programs for CRC may fall into three scenarios. First, CTC is recommended in FOBT-positive subjects when colonoscopy is refused, incomplete or contraindicated. For these indications CTC should replace double-contrast barium enema. Second, conversely, CTC is not currently recommended as a second-level examination prior to colonoscopy in all FOBT-positive subjects, as this strategy is most probably not cost-effective. Finally, CTC may be considered instead of colonoscopy for surveillance after adenoma removal, but specific studies are needed."

ZIKV is a virus transmitted by arthropods (arboviruses), mainly by Aedes mosquitoes. ZIKV can also be transmitted to humans through mechanisms other than vector infection such as sexual intercourse, blood transfusions, and mother-to-child transmission. The latter mode of transmission can give rise to a severe clinical form called congenital Zika syndrome (CZS), which can result in spontaneous abortion or serious pathological alterations in the fetus such as microcephaly or neurological and orofacial anomalies. In this study, beside a succinct overview of the etiological, microbiological, and epidemiological aspects and modes of transmission of Zika virus infections, we have focused our attention on the pathogenetic and histopathological aspects in pregnancy and the pathogenetic and molecular mechanisms that can determine microcephaly, and consequently the clinical alterations, typical of the fetus and newborns, in a subject affected by CZS."

Viral RNA was detected through qRT-PCR in a serum sample. In addition, the seroconversion of anti-Zika IgM and IgG antibodies was detected in repeated blood samples. Subsequently, the virus was isolated from the C6/36 cell line. The detected ZIKV belonged to the African lineage, the Nigerian sublineage. The strains with the closest sequences were isolated from mosquitoes in Senegal in 2011 and 2015.

This systematic review explores whether maternal gestational viral respiratory infections are associated with neurodevelopmental deviations in children below 10 years-old. The search was conducted in Pubmed, PsychInfo and Web of Science databases. 13 articles were revised, including information about maternal infection (Influenza, SARS-CoV-2 and unspecified respiratory infections) and offspring's neurodevelopment (global development, specific functions, temperament and behavioral/emotional aspects). Controversial results were reported regarding maternal respiratory infections during pregnancy and infants' neurodevelopment. Maternal infections seem to be associated with subtle alterations in some offspring's developmental subdomains, as early motor development, and attentional, behavioral/emotional minor problems.

Herein, we analyzed the impact of maternal overweight/obesity on the antiviral factors' expression in the placental tissue of Zika-infected mothers. We accessed placentas from women with and without obesity from 34 public health units (S\u00e3o Paulo) and from Zika-infected mothers with and without obesity from the Clinical Cohort Study of ZIKV pregnant women (Rio de Janeiro, Brazil). We first verified that obesity, without infection, did not alter the constitutive transcriptional expression of antiviral factors or IFN type I/III expression. Interestingly, obesity, when associated with ZIKV infection, showed a decreased transcriptional expression of RIG-I and IFIH1 (MDA-5 protein precursor gene). At the protein level, we also verified a decreased RIG-I and IRF-3 expression in the decidual placenta from the Zika-infected obese group, regardless of microcephaly. This finding shows, for the first time, that obesity associated with ZIKV infection leads to an impaired type I IFN downstream signaling pathway in the maternal-fetal interface."

In this review, we characterize decidual and placental immunity during maternal viral (co)-infection with HIV-1, human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), and Zika virus. We discuss placental immunology, clinical presentation, and epidemiology, before characterizing host susceptibility and cellular tropism, and how the three viruses gain access into specific placental target cells. We describe current knowledge on host-viral interactions with decidual and stromal human placental macrophages or Hofbauer cells, trophoblasts including extra villous trophoblasts, T cells, and decidual natural killer (dNK) cells. These clinically significant viral infections elicit both innate and adaptive immune responses to control replication. However, the three viruses either during mono- or co-infection (HIV-1 and HCMV) escape detection to initiate placental inflammation associated with viral transmission to the developing fetus. Aside from congenital or perinatal infection, other adverse pregnancy outcomes include preterm labor and spontaneous abortion. In addition, maternal HIV-1 and HCMV co-infection are associated with impaired fetal and infant immunity in postnatal life and poor clinical outcomes during childhood in exposed infants, even in the absence of vertical transmission of HIV-1. Given the rapidly expanding numbers of HIV-1-exposed uninfected infants and children globally, further research is urgently needed on neonatal immune programming during maternal mono-and co-infection. This review therefore includes sections on current knowledge gaps that may prompt future research directions. These gaps reflect an emerging but poorly characterized field. Their significance and potential investigation is underscored by the fact that although viral infections result in adverse consequences in both mother and developing fetus/newborn, antiviral and immunomodulatory therapies can improve clinical outcomes in the dyad."

In many cases these outbreaks have had considerable perinatal health consequences including increased risk of preterm delivery (e.g., influenza, measles, and COVID-19), and the delivery of low birth weight or small for gestational age babies (e.g., influenza, COVID-19). Furthermore, severe perinatal outcomes including perinatal and infant death are a known consequence of multiple infectious diseases (e.g., Ebola virus disease, Zika virus disease, pertussis, and measles). In addition to vaccination during pregnancy (where possible), pregnant women, are provided some level of protection from the adverse effects of infection through community-level application of evidence-based transmission-control methods. This review demonstrates that it takes almost 2 years for the perinatal impacts of an infectious disease outbreak to be reported. However, many infectious disease outbreaks between 2010 and 2020 have no associated pregnancy data reported in the scientific literature, or pregnancy data is reported in the form of case-studies only. This lack of systematic data collection and reporting has a negative impact on our understanding of these diseases and the implications they may have for pregnant women and their unborn infants. Monitoring perinatal health is an essential aspect of national and global healthcare strategies as perinatal life has a critical impact on early life mortality as well as possible effects on later life health. The unpredictable nature of emerging infections and the potential for adverse perinatal outcomes necessitate that we thoroughly assess pregnancy and perinatal health implications of disease outbreaks and their public health interventions in tandem with outbreak response efforts. Disease surveillance programs should incorporate perinatal health monitoring and health systems around the world should endeavor to continuously collect perinatal health data in order to quickly update pregnancy care protocols as needed."

Infections in pregnant women are of major concern because of potential devastating consequences during pregnancy and have been associated with microcephaly in newborns. ZIKV has a unique ability to use the host machinery to promote viral replication in a tissue-specific manner, resulting in characteristic pathological disorders. Recent studies have proposed that the host ubiquitin system acts as a major determinant of ZIKV tropism by providing the virus with an enhanced ability to enter new cells. In addition, ZIKV has developed mechanisms to evade the host immune response, thereby allowing the establishment of viral persistence and enhancing viral pathogenesis. We discuss recent reports on the mechanisms used by ZIKV to replicate efficiently, and we highlight potential new areas of research for the development of therapeutic approaches."

This resulted in forty-five human cases, including seven deaths, and the identification of JEV infection in over 80 commercial piggeries. <b><i>Materials and Methods:</i></b> We collected mosquitoes which were trapped using CO<sub>2</sub>-baited light traps deployed near piggeries reporting disease or in regions linked to human cases in the Wide Bay region in the state of Queensland. Mosquitoes from four traps yielded JEV RNA by real-time RT-PCR. Pools containing RNA positive mosquitoes were inoculated onto mosquito cell monolayers. <b><i>Discussion:</i></b> A single isolate of JEV was obtained from a pool of mixed mosquito species. Near whole genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of the JEV isolate demonstrated its high genomic relatedness with JEV GIV pig sequences sampled from Queensland and the state of New South Wales in 2022. <b><i>Conclusion:</i></b> We report the first isolation of JEV GIV from mosquitoes collected in Australia. With only a few JEV GIV isolates available globally, the isolate we report will be essential for future research of JEV host interactions, evolution and disease markers, and development of effective therapies, vaccines, diagnostic assays, and mosquito control strategies."

Fortunately, the development of vaccines has enabled effective defense against JE. However, re-emerging genotype V (GV) JEV poses a challenge as current vaccines are genotype III (GIII)-based and provide suboptimal protection. Given the isolation of GV JEVs from Malaysia, China, and the Republic of Korea, there is a concern about the potential for a broader outbreak. Under the hypothesis that a GV-based vaccine is necessary for effective defense against GV JEV, we developed a pentameric recombinant antigen using cholera toxin B as a scaffold and mucosal adjuvant, which was conjugated with the E protein domain III of GV by genetic fusion. This GV-based vaccine antigen induced a more effective immune response in mice against GV JEV isolates compared to GIII-based antigen and efficiently protected animals from lethal challenges. Furthermore, a bivalent vaccine approach, inoculating simultaneously with GIII- and GV-based antigens, showed protective efficacy against both GIII and GV JEVs. This strategy presents a promising avenue for comprehensive protection in regions facing the threat of diverse JEV genotypes, including both prevalent GIII and GI as well as emerging GV strains."

However, the burden of chikungunya virus (CHIKV) among pediatric AES (pAES) is unknown from E-UP. We included 238 hospitalized pAES cases. The presence of IgM antibodies for CHIKV, and Dengue virus (DENV) was tested, and RT-PCR was performed for CHIKV and DENV in serologically confirmed CHIKV and DENV pAES cases. Positive samples were sequenced using Sangers sequencing. Further, to check for co-infection, IgM antibodies for other AES etiologies including Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), Leptospira and Orientia tsutsugamushi (OT) in serum were also investigated. IgM ELISA demonstrated 5.04% (12) positivity for CHIKV. Among CHIKV IgM positive, 3 (25%, 3/12) pAES patients died. CHIKV genome was detected in 3 pAES specimens. Among which, 2 CHIKV cases were also positive for OT DNA. Partially sequenced CHIKV were genotyped as ECSA.

Consequently, increasing VLPs production is important and can be achieved by optimizing expression plasmids and cell culture conditions. While attempting to express genotype III (GIII) Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) VLPs containing the G104H mutation in the envelope (E) protein, we failed to generate VLPs in COS-1 cells. However, VLPs production was restored by cultivating plasmid-transfected cells at a lower temperature, specifically 28\u00a0\u00b0C. Furthermore, we observed that the enhancement in JEV VLPs production was independent of amino acid mutations in the E protein. The optimal condition for JEV VLPs production in plasmid-transfected COS-1 cells consisted of an initial culture at 37\u00a0\u00b0C for 6\u00a0h, followed by a shift to 28\u00a0\u00b0C (37/28\u00a0\u00b0C) for cultivation. Under 37/28\u00a0\u00b0C cultivation conditions, flavivirus VLPs production significantly increased in various mammalian cell lines regardless of whether its expression was transiently transfected or clonally selected cells. Remarkably, clonally selected cell lines expressing flavivirus VLPs consistently achieved yields exceeding 1\u00a0\u03bcg/ml. Binding affinity analyses using monoclonal antibodies revealed similar binding patterns for VLPs of genotype I (GI) JEV, GIII JEV, West Nile virus (WNV), and dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV-2) produced under both 37\u00a0\u00b0C or 37/28\u00a0\u00b0C cultivation conditions. In summary, our study demonstrated that the production of flavivirus VLPs can be significantly improved under 37/28\u00a0\u00b0C cultivation conditions without affecting the conformational structure of the E protein. KEYPOINTS: \u2022 Low-temperature culture (37/28\u00a0\u00b0C) enhances production of flavivirus VLPs. \u2022 Flavivirus VLPs consistently achieved yields exceeding 1\u00a0\u03bcg/ml. \u2022 37/28\u00a0\u00b0C cultivation did not alter the structure of flavivirus VLPs."

The JEV duck/2022-SD-1 strain was classified into genotype I cluster and shared 96.5 to 99.5 % nucleotide sequence identity with other GI JEV strains. Biological characteristics revealed that duck/2022-SD-1 possessed similar replication ability to a virulent strain Beijing/2020-1. Based on the amino acid identity comparison of E protein, amino acid sites responsible for JEV virulence were conserved between duck/2022-SD-1 and other virulence strains. Through virulence assays in mice, we further determined that duck/2022-SD-1 was a highly virulent JEV strain with highly neuroinvasive in mice, which is similar to the virulence of another virulent strain Beijing/2020-1.

However, no clinically approved drug is available to treat JEV infection, and currently available commercial vaccines derived from JEV GIII strains provide only partial protection against GI. Utilizing a reverse genetics system, this study attempted to produce a novel chimeric JEV strain with high efficacy against JEV GI. Accordingly, a GI/GIII intertypic recombinant strain, namely SA14-GI env, was generated by substituting the E region of the GIII SA14-14-2 strain with that of the GI strain, K05GS. The neurovirulence of the mutant virus was significantly reduced in mice. Analysis of the immunogenicity of the chimeric virus revealed that it induced neutralizing antibodies against JEV GI in mice, and the protective efficacy of SA14-GI env was higher than that of SA14-14-2. These findings suggest that SA14-GI env may be a safe and effective live-attenuated vaccine candidate against JEV GI."

The N-terminal protease domain (180 residues) of NS3 (NS3(pro)) interacts directly with a central 40-amino acid hydrophilic domain of NS2B (NS2B(H)) to form an active serine protease. In this study, the recombinant NS2B(H)-NS3(pro) proteases were prepared in <i>E. coli</i> and used to compare the enzymatic activity between genotype I (GI) and III (GIII) NS2B-NS3 proteases. The GI NS2B(H)-NS3(pro) was able to cleave the sites at internal C, NS2A/NS2B, NS2B/NS3 and NS3/NS4A junctions that were identical to the sites proteolytically processed by GIII NS2B(H)-NS3(pro). Analysis of the enzymatic activity of recombinant NS2B(H)-NS3(pro) proteases using a model of fluorogenic peptide substrate revealed that the proteolytical processing activity of GIII NS2B(H)-NS3(pro) was significantly higher than that of GI NS2B(H)-NS3(pro). There were eight amino acid variations between GI and GIII NS2B(H)-NS3(pro), which may be responsible for the difference in enzymatic activities between GI and GIII proteases. Therefore, recombinant mutants were generated by exchanging NS2B(H) and NS3(pro) domains between GI and GIII NS2B(H)-NS3(pro) and subjected to protease activity analysis. Substitution of NS2B(H) significantly altered the protease activities, as compared to the parental NS2B(H)-NS3(pro), suggesting that NS2B(H) played an essential role in regulation of NS3(pro) protease activity. To further identify the amino acids responsible for the difference in protease activities, multiple substitution mutants including the individual and combined mutations at the variant residue 55 and 65 of NS2B(H) were generated and subjected to protease activity analysis. Replacement of NS2B-55 and NS2B-65 of GI to GIII significantly increased the enzymatic activity of GI NS2B(H)-NS3(pro) protease, whereas mutation of NS2B-55 and NS2B-65 of GIII to GI remarkably reduced the enzymatic activity of GIII NS2B(H)-NS3(pro) protease. Overall, these data demonstrated that NS2B-55 and NS2B-65 variations in hydrophilic domain of NS2B co-contributed to the difference in NS2B(H)-NS3(pro) protease activities between GI and GIII. These observations gain an insight into the role of NS2B in regulation of NS3 protease activities, which is useful for understanding the replication of JEV GI and GIII viruses."

From 2009, the hidden genotype 5 suddenly emerged simultaneously in mosquitoes from the Tibetan region of China and those from South Korea in East Asia. The detection of genotype 5 of JEV in these mosquitoes was associated with cases of viral encephalitis in the local population. Similarly, in 2022, the long-silent genotype 4 of JEV emerged in Australia, resulting in a local outbreak of viral encephalitis that primarily affected adults and caused fatalities. The emergence and outbreaks of genotypes 4 and 5 of JEV present new challenges for the prevention and control of Japanese encephalitis (JE).

Herein, we aimed to assess the impact of baseline preexisting proteinuria on regorafenib-induced problematic proteinuria during real-world mCRC therapy. Patients with mCRC receiving regorafenib (n\u2009=\u2009100) were retrospectively assessed and divided into control and preexisting proteinuria (baseline grade of 1-2) groups.

This review describes the preclinical and clinical research with pimitespib, including its mechanism of action, pharmacokinetics, clinical antitumour activity and safety. In a phase III study, pimitespib significantly prolonged progression-free survival compared with placebo (median 2.8 vs 1.4\u00a0months; hazard ratio 0.51; 95% CI 0.30-0.87;\u00a0p\u00a0=\u00a00.006). Common treatment-related adverse events were diarrhoea, decreased appetite, increase in serum creatinine, malaise, nausea and eye disorders. The efficacy and safety of pimitespib are being investigated in other tumour types and in combination with other anticancer therapies."

                    "text": "Over the past 20 years, numerous tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have been introduced for targeted therapy of various types of malignancies. Due to frequent and increasing use, leading to eventual excretion with body fluids, their residues have been found in hospital and household wastewaters as well as surface water. However, the effects of TKI residues in the environment on aquatic organisms are poorly described. In the present study, we investigated the cytotoxic and genotoxic effects of five selected TKIs, namely erlotinib (ERL), dasatinib (DAS), nilotinib (NIL), regorafenib (REG), and sorafenib (SOR), using the in vitro zebrafish liver cell (ZFL) model. Cytotoxicity was determined using the MTS assay and propidium iodide (PI) live/dead staining by flow cytometry. DAS, SOR, and REG decreased ZFL cell viability dose- and time-dependently, with DAS being the most cytotoxic TKI studied. ERL and NIL did not affect viability at concentrations up to their maximum solubility; however, NIL was the only TKI that significantly decreased the proportion of PI negative cells as determined by the flow cytometry. Cell cycle progression analyses showed that DAS, ERL, REG, and SOR caused the cell cycle arrest of ZFL cells in the G0/G1 phase, with a concomitant decrease of cells in the S-phase fraction. No data could be obtained for NIL due to severe DNA fragmentation. The genotoxic activity of the investigated TKIs was evaluated using comet and cytokinesis block micronucleus (CBMN) assays. The dose-dependent induction of DNA single strand breaks was induced by NIL (\u22652 \u03bcM), DAS (\u22650.006 \u03bcM), and REG (\u22650.8 \u03bcM), with DAS being the most potent. None of the TKIs studied induced micronuclei formation. These results suggest that normal non-target fish liver cells are sensitive to the TKIs studied in a concentration range similar to those previously reported for human cancer cell lines. Although the TKI concentrations that induced adverse effects in exposed ZFL cells are several orders of magnitude higher than those currently expected in the aquatic environment, the observed DNA damage and cell cycle effects suggest that residues of TKIs in the environment may pose a hazard to non-intentionally exposed organisms living in environments contaminated with TKIs."

Patients with severe asthma represent a substantial share of consumption of healthcare resources and hospitalization. Moreover, these patients are at risk of increased morbidity and mortality. Recently, several phenotypes and endotypes of asthma have been identified. The identification of specific subtypes of asthma is fundamental for optimizing the clinical benefit of novel treatments. Although in most patients the disease can be controlled by some combination of pharmacologic agents, in some 5-10% of patients the disease remains uncontrolled. Several monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting pathogenetic molecules (e.g., IgE, IL-5, IL- 5R\u03b1, IL-4, IL-13, TSLP) are currently available or under development for the treatment of different forms of severe type 2 asthma. The identification of diagnostic and predictive biomarkers (e.g., IgE, blood eosinophil count, FeNO, periostin, etc.) has revolutioned the field of targeted therapy in severe asthma. Monoclonal antibodies targeting Th2-driven inflammation are generally safe in adult patients with moderate-to-severe asthma. The long-term safety of these biologics is a relevant issue that should be addressed. Unfortunately, little is known about non-type 2 asthma. Further studies are needed to identify biomarkers to guide targeted therapies of different forms of non-type 2 asthma."

Some herpesviruses persist within dividing cells, putting the viral genome at risk of being lost to the cytoplasm during mitosis because karyokinesis (nuclear division) requires nuclear envelope breakdown. Oncogenic herpesviruses (and papillomaviruses) avoid genome loss during mitosis by tethering their genomes to cellular chromosomes, thereby ensuring viral genome uptake into newly formed nuclei. These viruses use viral proteins with DNA- and chromatin-binding capabilities to physically link viral and cellular genomes together in a process called tethering. The known viral tethering proteins of human papillomavirus (E2), Epstein-Barr virus (EBNA1), and Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (LANA) each contain two independent domains required for genome tethering, one that binds sequence specifically to the viral genome and another that binds to cellular chromatin. This latter domain is called a chromatin tethering domain (CTD). The human cytomegalovirus UL123 gene encodes a CTD that is required for the virus to productively infect dividing fibroblast cells within the S phase of the cell cycle, presumably by tethering the viral genome to cellular chromosomes during mitosis. The CTD-containing UL123 gene product that supports S-phase infections is the IE19 protein. Here, we define two motifs in IE19 required for S-phase infections: an N-terminal triple lysine motif and a C-terminal nucleosome-binding motif within the CTD.IMPORTANCEThe IE19 protein encoded by human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is required for S-phase infection of dividing cells, likely because it tethers the viral genome to cellular chromosomes, thereby allowing them to survive mitosis. The mechanism through which IE19 tethers viral genomes to cellular chromosomes is not understood. For human papillomavirus, Epstein-Barr virus, and Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus, viral genome tethering is required for persistence (latency) and pathogenesis (oncogenesis). Like these viruses, HCMV also achieves latency, and it modulates the properties of glioblastoma multiforme tumors. Therefore, defining the mechanism through which IE19 tethers viral genomes to cellular chromosomes may help us understand, and ultimately combat or control, HCMV latency and oncomodulation."

However, less data is available for this avertible cancer regarding its association with high-risk HPV (HR-HPV) and chewing habits in this region. Therefore, this study was done to determine the prevalence of HR-HPV in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) and its correlation with p16 and chewing habits. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) biopsy specimens of 186 samples were tested for HR-HPV type 16/18 by PCR, followed by p16 immunostaining (IHC) in a subset of cases (n = 50). Appropriate statistical tests were applied to find the association between HR-HPV/p16 and peculiar chewing habits with significance criteria of p<0.05 with 95% CI. HR-HPV (type 16 &18) was present in seven out of 186 cases (3.8%). Of these seven cases, five were positive for HPV16, whereas two were positive for HPV16/18. The overall expression of p16 protein in 50 samples was 38% (n = 19), and among these 19-IHC positive samples, 26% were positive for HR-HPV DNA. No significant association was found between HR-HPV positivity and p16 and chewing habits (p>0.05). It was concluded that HR-HPV prevalence in OSCC was very low in our population, with no statistically significant correlation with p16 and chewing habits. These results suggest the role of HR-HPV as an independent risk factor in OSCC in the local setting."

High-resolution anoscopy (HRA) is an in-clinic procedure to detect precancerous anal lesions and cancer, yet prospective data on factors associated with HRA attendance are lacking. We examined whether anal HPV sampling at home versus in a clinic impacts HRA uptake and assessed HRA acceptability. Methods Sexual and gender minority individuals were randomised to home-based self-sampling or clinical sampling. All were asked to attend in-clinic HRA 1year later. We regressed HRA attendance on study arm using multivariable Poisson regression and assessed HRA acceptability using \u03c7 2 tests. Results A total of 62.8% of 196 participants who engaged in screening attended HRA. Although not significant (P =0.13), a higher proportion of participants who engaged in clinic-based screening attended HRA (68.5%) compared to home-based participants (57.9%). Overall, HRA uptake was higher among participants with anal cytology history (aRR 1.40, 95% CI 1.07-1.82), and lower among participants preferring a versatile anal sex position versus insertive (aRR 0.70, 95% CI 0.53-0.91), but did not differ by race or HIV serostatus. In the clinic arm, persons living with HIV had lower HRA attendance (42.9%) versus HIV-negative participants (73.3%) (P =0.02) and Black non-Hispanic participants had lower HRA attendance (41.7%) than White non-Hispanic participants (73.1%), (P =0.04). No differences in attendance by race or HIV status were observed in the home arm. Conclusions HRA uptake differed significantly by race and HIV status in the clinic arm but not the home arm."

According to research, vaccines are immunogenic and safe for pregnant women. Pregnancy is not an absolute contraindication to vaccination.

The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), guidelines of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology (ACOG) unanimously recommend vaccination of pregnant women if a safe vaccine is available and there is a risk of exposure of the woman to a disease that threatens herself or her developing baby. In everyday clinical practice, medical professionals should provide their patients with the necessary information on vaccinations, which may contribute to greater awareness and implementation of vaccinations. This article aims to review current global recommendations for the vaccination of pregnant and breastfeeding women, including against the Omicron variants of SARS-CoV-2."

                    "text": "Border disease virus (BDV) is a member of the pestivirus genus that primarily affects sheep, causing reproductive losses through abortion, still births and the birth of weak lambs. The key characteristic of this disease is the birth of persistently infected (PI) lambs which, after surviving transplacental infection, are born antibody negative, yet virus positive, and thus shed the virus for their entire life and are the primary source of spread within a flock. The cornerstones of BDV control are detection and elimination of PI animals, biosecurity measures to prevent re-infection, and surveillance programs. Recommendations for the control of BDV in sheep are centred around the approach to bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV), the prominent cattle pestivirus species, due to a lack of specific research into BDV control and elimination. In this study, two aspects of a BDV control program were investigated: the effectiveness of the BVDV vaccine, Pestigard\u00ae, and the rate of seroconversion in a flock deliberately exposed to known PI lambs. The vaccine appeared to be safe, and the optimal dose was the full cattle dose (2\u2009mL). While vaccination induced high virus neutralising titres to BVDV when administered as either a quarter, half or full dose registered for cattle, the BDV titres achieved were low and unlikely to prevent transplacental infection. In a second study, after exposure of between 2 and 15\u2009days exposure to two PI lambs in confined conditions, only 3 of 66 previously na\u00efve sheep demonstrated seroconversion. This demonstrated a very low rate of transmission and suggested that deliberate exposure to PI lambs at low-risk times for less than 15\u2009days was not likely to be an effective means of achieving seroconversion throughout a flock and, therefore, not provide protection against BDV challenge during gestation."

Vaccination can reduce the burden of RSV-related respiratory disease, with previous studies showing its substantial medical and financial burden in Jordan. However, pregnant women may exhibit hesitancy to get vaccinated due to concerns about potential risks to themselves or their fetuses. This study aimed to assess the acceptance of the RSV vaccine among young females and identify the determinants influencing their decision using a newly constructed instrument. A survey instrument was developed and validated, comprising 26 items to measure RSV vaccine acceptance. A cross-sectional study design was employed, with data collection from a sample of females aged 18 to 45 residing in Jordan during 5-6 July 2023, using a convenient approach via an online distributed questionnaire. The final study sample comprised 315 respondents, with 67.6% who have heard of RSV before the study. If the vaccine was safe, effective, and provided freely, 70.2% showed willingness to get the RSV vaccine, 15.2% resisted, and 14.6% were hesitant. Principal component analysis identified six internally consistent sub-scales with the following suggested themes: Advice, Burden, Conspiracy, Dangers, Efficiency, and Fear, comprising 21 items collectively as assigned as the \"ABCDEF\" scale for RSV vaccine acceptance. RSV vaccine acceptance in this study was associated with the advice and fear constructs. The validated survey instrument successfully captured important determinants of RSV vaccine acceptance among young females. RSV vaccine promotion efforts should focus on the following: enhancing vaccine education, improving trust in healthcare institutions and providers, reducing burdens through resolving cost issues and focusing on the role of social support, addressing safety concerns, and tailoring communication strategies to effectively promote the benefits of the vaccine. These insights can inform public health policies and interventions aiming to promote RSV vaccination and mitigate the burden of RSV-related diseases among infants. Follow-up studies are recommended with pregnant women as the target group to assess their attitude towards RSV vaccination and to confirm the validity of the conceived ABCDEF survey instrument."

The aim of the study was to evaluate the safety and kinetics of antibody responses in water buffaloes vaccinated according to the protocol described for the bovine species in the WOAH Manual, modified with the use of a triple dose. Water buffaloes were vaccinated with the vaccine RB51. A booster vaccination was administered at 12 months of age. When turning 23-25 months old, female animals were induced to pregnancy. RB51-specific antibodies were detected and quantified using a CFT based on the RB51 antigen. Vaccinated animals showed a positive serological reaction following each vaccine injection, but titers and the duration of the antibody differed among animals. For 36 weeks after booster vaccination, the comparison of CFT values between vaccinated and control groups remained constantly significant. Afterwards, antibody titers decreased. No relevant changes in antibody response were recorded during pregnancy or lactation. In conclusion, results indicated that the vaccination schedule applied is safe and allows for vaccinated and unvaccinated controls to be discriminated between for up to 8 months after booster vaccination."

The prevailing Th2 profile in advanced CTCL underscores the significance of understanding IL-4/IL-13 expression dynamics from the early stages of disease, as a shift from Th1 to Th2 may explain CTCL progression. Targeted agents blocking key cytokines of type 2 immunity are established therapeutics in atopic disorders and have a promising therapeutic potential in CTCL, given their involvement in cutaneous symptoms and their contribution to the pathogenesis of disease.

Fewer than 20% of patients only survive beyond five years from diagnosis. CRC is a highly preventable disease if diagnosed at the early stage of malignancy. Several screening methods like endoscopy (like colonoscopy; gold standard), imaging examination [computed tomographic colonography (CTC)], guaiac-based fecal occult blood (gFOBT), immunochemical test from faeces, and stool DNA test are available with different levels of sensitivity and specificity. The available screening methods are associated with certain drawbacks like invasiveness, cost, or sensitivity. In recent years, computer-aided systems-based screening, diagnosis, and treatment have been very promising in the early-stage detection and diagnosis of CRC cases. Artificial intelligence (AI) is an enormously in-demand, cost-effective technology, that uses various tools machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) to screen, diagnose, and stage, and has great potential to treat CRC. Moreover, different ML algorithms and neural networks [artificial neural network (ANN), k-nearest neighbors (KNN), and support vector machines (SVMs)] have been deployed to predict precise and personalized treatment options.

CT colonography uses minimally invasive evaluation of colorectum and has better patient acceptance, which appears to be a promising screening modality to improve low colorectal cancer screening rate. This study investigated the utilization patterns of CT colonography and factors associated with its use among U.S. adult population. This retrospective cross-sectional study analyzed the National Health Interview Survey 2015 and 2018. U.S. adults ages 45 or older without a history of colorectal cancer were included. Survey design-adjusted Wald F tests were used to compare the utilization of CT colonography during the study period. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify the predictors of CT colonography among individual socioeconomic and health-related characteristics. The study sample included 34,768 individuals representing 129,430,319 U.S. adult population ages 45 or older. The overall utilization of CT colonography increased from 0.79% in 2015 to 1.33% in 2018 (<i>P</i> < 0.001). 54.5% study participants reported being up-to-date on recommended colorectal cancer screening; of those, 1.8% used CT colonography. Compared with individuals ages 65+, those ages 45-49 years were 2.08 times (OR, 2.08, 95% confidence interval, 1.01-4.35) more likely to use CT colonography. Socioeconomically disadvantaged characteristics (e.g., racial/ethnic minority, low income, publicly funded insurance) were associated with a greater likelihood of CT colonography. This study demonstrated an increasing trend in utilization of CT colonography for colorectal cancer screening in U.S. adults. Younger individuals, racial/ethnic minorities, or those with lower income appear to have a higher CT colonography utilization. PREVENTION RELEVANCE: Although computed tomographic (CT) colonography has been proved to be cost-effective and have better patient acceptance, its overall utilization for colorectal cancer (CRC) screening is low (<1.4%) among US adults aged 45+ in 2018. More efforts are needed to implement strategies to increase CT colonography for effective CRC prevention."

Materials and Methods Observed participation rates and screening costs from the Colonoscopy or Colonography for Screening, or COCOS, trial were used in a microsimulation model to estimate costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained with colonoscopy and CT colonography screening. For both tests, the authors determined optimal age range and screening interval combinations assuming a 100% participation rate. Assuming observed participation for these combinations, the cost-effectiveness of both tests was compared. Extracolonic findings were not included because long-term follow-up data are lacking. Results The participation rates for colonoscopy and CT colonography were 21.5% (1276 of 5924 invitees) and 33.6% (982 of 2920 invitees), respectively. Colonoscopy was more cost-effective in the screening strategies with one or two lifetime screenings, whereas CT colonography was more cost-effective in strategies with more lifetime screenings. CT colonography was the preferred test for willingness-to-pay-thresholds of \u20ac3200 per QALY gained and higher, which is lower than the Dutch willingness-to-pay threshold of \u20ac20 000. With equal participation, colonoscopy was the preferred test independent of willingness-to-pay thresholds. The findings were robust for most of the sensitivity analyses, except with regard to relative screening costs and subsequent participation. Conclusion Because of the higher participation rates, CT colonography screening for colorectal cancer is more cost-effective than colonoscopy screening. The implementation of CT colonography screening requires previous satisfactory resolution to the question as to how best to deal with extracolonic findings. <sup>\u00a9</sup> RSNA, 2018 Online supplemental material is available for this article."

While the role of CTC as a primary test for population screening of CRC is under investigation, the fecal occult blood test (FOBT) has been recommended for population screening of CRC in Europe. Subjects with positive FOBT are invited to undergo total colonoscopy, which has some critical issues, such as suboptimal compliance, contraindications and the possibility of an incomplete exploration of the colon. Based on available data, the integration of CTC in FOBT-based population screening programs for CRC may fall into three scenarios. First, CTC is recommended in FOBT-positive subjects when colonoscopy is refused, incomplete or contraindicated. For these indications CTC should replace double-contrast barium enema. Second, conversely, CTC is not currently recommended as a second-level examination prior to colonoscopy in all FOBT-positive subjects, as this strategy is most probably not cost-effective. Finally, CTC may be considered instead of colonoscopy for surveillance after adenoma removal, but specific studies are needed."

Microcephaly is one of the possible complications found in newborns exposed to Zika virus (ZIKV) during pregnancy, although it is an impacting clinical sign. This study aimed to investigate the consequences of a model of congenital ZIKV infection by evaluating the histopathology, blood-brain barrier, and neuroinflammation in pup rats 24\u00a0h after birth, and neurodevelopment of the offspring. Pregnant rats were inoculated subcutaneously with ZIKV-BR at the dose 1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>7</sup> plaque-forming unit (PFU mL-1) of ZIKV isolated in Brazil (ZIKV-BR) on gestational day 18 (G18). A set of pups, 24\u00a0h after birth, was euthanized. The brain was collected and later evaluated for the histopathology of brain structures through histological analysis. Additionally, analyses of the blood-brain barrier were conducted using western blotting, and neuroinflammation was assessed using ELISA. Another set of animals was evaluated on postnatal days 3, 6, 9, and 12 for neurodevelopment by observing the developmental milestones. Our results revealed hippocampal atrophy in ZIKV animals, in addition to changes in the blood-brain barrier structure and pro-inflammatory cytokines expression increase. Regarding neurodevelopment, a delay in important reflexes during the neonatal period in ZIKV animals was observed. These findings advance the understanding of the pathophysiology of CZS and contribute to enhancing the rat model of CZS."

ZIKV is a virus transmitted by arthropods (arboviruses), mainly by Aedes mosquitoes. ZIKV can also be transmitted to humans through mechanisms other than vector infection such as sexual intercourse, blood transfusions, and mother-to-child transmission. The latter mode of transmission can give rise to a severe clinical form called congenital Zika syndrome (CZS), which can result in spontaneous abortion or serious pathological alterations in the fetus such as microcephaly or neurological and orofacial anomalies. In this study, beside a succinct overview of the etiological, microbiological, and epidemiological aspects and modes of transmission of Zika virus infections, we have focused our attention on the pathogenetic and histopathological aspects in pregnancy and the pathogenetic and molecular mechanisms that can determine microcephaly, and consequently the clinical alterations, typical of the fetus and newborns, in a subject affected by CZS."

The latter became the cause of the 2015-2016 pandemic, with severe consequences for newborns. In West African countries, the African lineage was found, but there is evidence of the emergence of the Asian-American lineage in Cape Verde and Angola. This highlights the need to not only monitor ZIKV but also sequence the isolates. In this article, we present a case report of Zika fever in a pregnant woman from Guinea identified in 2018. Viral RNA was detected through qRT-PCR in a serum sample. In addition, the seroconversion of anti-Zika IgM and IgG antibodies was detected in repeated blood samples. Subsequently, the virus was isolated from the C6/36 cell line. The detected ZIKV belonged to the African lineage, the Nigerian sublineage. The strains with the closest sequences were isolated from mosquitoes in Senegal in 2011 and 2015. In addition, we conducted the serological screening of 116 blood samples collected from patients presenting to the hospital of Faranah with fevers during the period 2018-2021. As a result, it was found that IgM-positive patients were identified each year and that the seroprevalence varied between 5.6% and 17.1%."

However, little is known about the neurodevelopmental consequences of maternal respiratory viral infections, which are the most prevalent infections during pregnancy. The recent COVID-19 pandemic has increased the interest in understanding the consequences of infections in offspring's development. This systematic review explores whether maternal gestational viral respiratory infections are associated with neurodevelopmental deviations in children below 10 years-old. The search was conducted in Pubmed, PsychInfo and Web of Science databases. 13 articles were revised, including information about maternal infection (Influenza, SARS-CoV-2 and unspecified respiratory infections) and offspring's neurodevelopment (global development, specific functions, temperament and behavioral/emotional aspects). Controversial results were reported regarding maternal respiratory infections during pregnancy and infants' neurodevelopment. Maternal infections seem to be associated with subtle alterations in some offspring's developmental subdomains, as early motor development, and attentional, behavioral/emotional minor problems. Further studies are needed to determine the impact of other psychosocial confounding factors."

During this period, viral infections represent a risk to the mother, the placental unit, and the fetus. The Zika virus (ZIKV) outbreak in Brazil has been the cause of congenital Zika syndrome (CZS), with devastating consequences such as microcephaly in newborns. Herein, we analyzed the impact of maternal overweight/obesity on the antiviral factors' expression in the placental tissue of Zika-infected mothers. We accessed placentas from women with and without obesity from 34 public health units (S\u00e3o Paulo) and from Zika-infected mothers with and without obesity from the Clinical Cohort Study of ZIKV pregnant women (Rio de Janeiro, Brazil). We first verified that obesity, without infection, did not alter the constitutive transcriptional expression of antiviral factors or IFN type I/III expression. Interestingly, obesity, when associated with ZIKV infection, showed a decreased transcriptional expression of RIG-I and IFIH1 (MDA-5 protein precursor gene). At the protein level, we also verified a decreased RIG-I and IRF-3 expression in the decidual placenta from the Zika-infected obese group, regardless of microcephaly. This finding shows, for the first time, that obesity associated with ZIKV infection leads to an impaired type I IFN downstream signaling pathway in the maternal-fetal interface."

In this review, we characterize decidual and placental immunity during maternal viral (co)-infection with HIV-1, human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), and Zika virus. We discuss placental immunology, clinical presentation, and epidemiology, before characterizing host susceptibility and cellular tropism, and how the three viruses gain access into specific placental target cells. We describe current knowledge on host-viral interactions with decidual and stromal human placental macrophages or Hofbauer cells, trophoblasts including extra villous trophoblasts, T cells, and decidual natural killer (dNK) cells. These clinically significant viral infections elicit both innate and adaptive immune responses to control replication. However, the three viruses either during mono- or co-infection (HIV-1 and HCMV) escape detection to initiate placental inflammation associated with viral transmission to the developing fetus. Aside from congenital or perinatal infection, other adverse pregnancy outcomes include preterm labor and spontaneous abortion. In addition, maternal HIV-1 and HCMV co-infection are associated with impaired fetal and infant immunity in postnatal life and poor clinical outcomes during childhood in exposed infants, even in the absence of vertical transmission of HIV-1. Given the rapidly expanding numbers of HIV-1-exposed uninfected infants and children globally, further research is urgently needed on neonatal immune programming during maternal mono-and co-infection. This review therefore includes sections on current knowledge gaps that may prompt future research directions. These gaps reflect an emerging but poorly characterized field. Their significance and potential investigation is underscored by the fact that although viral infections result in adverse consequences in both mother and developing fetus/newborn, antiviral and immunomodulatory therapies can improve clinical outcomes in the dyad."

In many cases these outbreaks have had considerable perinatal health consequences including increased risk of preterm delivery (e.g., influenza, measles, and COVID-19), and the delivery of low birth weight or small for gestational age babies (e.g., influenza, COVID-19). Furthermore, severe perinatal outcomes including perinatal and infant death are a known consequence of multiple infectious diseases (e.g., Ebola virus disease, Zika virus disease, pertussis, and measles). In addition to vaccination during pregnancy (where possible), pregnant women, are provided some level of protection from the adverse effects of infection through community-level application of evidence-based transmission-control methods. This review demonstrates that it takes almost 2 years for the perinatal impacts of an infectious disease outbreak to be reported. However, many infectious disease outbreaks between 2010 and 2020 have no associated pregnancy data reported in the scientific literature, or pregnancy data is reported in the form of case-studies only. This lack of systematic data collection and reporting has a negative impact on our understanding of these diseases and the implications they may have for pregnant women and their unborn infants. Monitoring perinatal health is an essential aspect of national and global healthcare strategies as perinatal life has a critical impact on early life mortality as well as possible effects on later life health. The unpredictable nature of emerging infections and the potential for adverse perinatal outcomes necessitate that we thoroughly assess pregnancy and perinatal health implications of disease outbreaks and their public health interventions in tandem with outbreak response efforts. Disease surveillance programs should incorporate perinatal health monitoring and health systems around the world should endeavor to continuously collect perinatal health data in order to quickly update pregnancy care protocols as needed."

ZIKV has a unique ability to use the host machinery to promote viral replication in a tissue-specific manner, resulting in characteristic pathological disorders. Recent studies have proposed that the host ubiquitin system acts as a major determinant of ZIKV tropism by providing the virus with an enhanced ability to enter new cells. In addition, ZIKV has developed mechanisms to evade the host immune response, thereby allowing the establishment of viral persistence and enhancing viral pathogenesis. We discuss recent reports on the mechanisms used by ZIKV to replicate efficiently, and we highlight potential new areas of research for the development of therapeutic approaches."

This resulted in forty-five human cases, including seven deaths, and the identification of JEV infection in over 80 commercial piggeries. <b><i>Materials and Methods:</i></b> We collected mosquitoes which were trapped using CO<sub>2</sub>-baited light traps deployed near piggeries reporting disease or in regions linked to human cases in the Wide Bay region in the state of Queensland. Mosquitoes from four traps yielded JEV RNA by real-time RT-PCR. Pools containing RNA positive mosquitoes were inoculated onto mosquito cell monolayers. <b><i>Discussion:</i></b> A single isolate of JEV was obtained from a pool of mixed mosquito species. Near whole genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of the JEV isolate demonstrated its high genomic relatedness with JEV GIV pig sequences sampled from Queensland and the state of New South Wales in 2022. <b><i>Conclusion:</i></b> We report the first isolation of JEV GIV from mosquitoes collected in Australia. With only a few JEV GIV isolates available globally, the isolate we report will be essential for future research of JEV host interactions, evolution and disease markers, and development of effective therapies, vaccines, diagnostic assays, and mosquito control strategies."

Fortunately, the development of vaccines has enabled effective defense against JE. However, re-emerging genotype V (GV) JEV poses a challenge as current vaccines are genotype III (GIII)-based and provide suboptimal protection. Given the isolation of GV JEVs from Malaysia, China, and the Republic of Korea, there is a concern about the potential for a broader outbreak. Under the hypothesis that a GV-based vaccine is necessary for effective defense against GV JEV, we developed a pentameric recombinant antigen using cholera toxin B as a scaffold and mucosal adjuvant, which was conjugated with the E protein domain III of GV by genetic fusion. This GV-based vaccine antigen induced a more effective immune response in mice against GV JEV isolates compared to GIII-based antigen and efficiently protected animals from lethal challenges. Furthermore, a bivalent vaccine approach, inoculating simultaneously with GIII- and GV-based antigens, showed protective efficacy against both GIII and GV JEVs. This strategy presents a promising avenue for comprehensive protection in regions facing the threat of diverse JEV genotypes, including both prevalent GIII and GI as well as emerging GV strains."

Consequently, increasing VLPs production is important and can be achieved by optimizing expression plasmids and cell culture conditions. While attempting to express genotype III (GIII) Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) VLPs containing the G104H mutation in the envelope (E) protein, we failed to generate VLPs in COS-1 cells. However, VLPs production was restored by cultivating plasmid-transfected cells at a lower temperature, specifically 28\u00a0\u00b0C. Furthermore, we observed that the enhancement in JEV VLPs production was independent of amino acid mutations in the E protein. The optimal condition for JEV VLPs production in plasmid-transfected COS-1 cells consisted of an initial culture at 37\u00a0\u00b0C for 6\u00a0h, followed by a shift to 28\u00a0\u00b0C (37/28\u00a0\u00b0C) for cultivation. Under 37/28\u00a0\u00b0C cultivation conditions, flavivirus VLPs production significantly increased in various mammalian cell lines regardless of whether its expression was transiently transfected or clonally selected cells. Remarkably, clonally selected cell lines expressing flavivirus VLPs consistently achieved yields exceeding 1\u00a0\u03bcg/ml. Binding affinity analyses using monoclonal antibodies revealed similar binding patterns for VLPs of genotype I (GI) JEV, GIII JEV, West Nile virus (WNV), and dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV-2) produced under both 37\u00a0\u00b0C or 37/28\u00a0\u00b0C cultivation conditions. In summary, our study demonstrated that the production of flavivirus VLPs can be significantly improved under 37/28\u00a0\u00b0C cultivation conditions without affecting the conformational structure of the E protein.

Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), a flavivirus, is responsible for JE. In Asia, Genotype I (GI) has emerged as the dominant strain, replacing Genotype III (GIII). However, no clinically approved drug is available to treat JEV infection, and currently available commercial vaccines derived from JEV GIII strains provide only partial protection against GI. Utilizing a reverse genetics system, this study attempted to produce a novel chimeric JEV strain with high efficacy against JEV GI. Accordingly, a GI/GIII intertypic recombinant strain, namely SA14-GI env, was generated by substituting the E region of the GIII SA14-14-2 strain with that of the GI strain, K05GS. The neurovirulence of the mutant virus was significantly reduced in mice. Analysis of the immunogenicity of the chimeric virus revealed that it induced neutralizing antibodies against JEV GI in mice, and the protective efficacy of SA14-GI env was higher than that of SA14-14-2. These findings suggest that SA14-GI env may be a safe and effective live-attenuated vaccine candidate against JEV GI."

                    "text": "Japanese Encephalitis Virus (JEV) NS2B-NS3 is a protein complex composed of NS3 proteases and a NS2B cofactor. The N-terminal protease domain (180 residues) of NS3 (NS3(pro)) interacts directly with a central 40-amino acid hydrophilic domain of NS2B (NS2B(H)) to form an active serine protease. In this study, the recombinant NS2B(H)-NS3(pro) proteases were prepared in <i>E. coli</i> and used to compare the enzymatic activity between genotype I (GI) and III (GIII) NS2B-NS3 proteases. The GI NS2B(H)-NS3(pro) was able to cleave the sites at internal C, NS2A/NS2B, NS2B/NS3 and NS3/NS4A junctions that were identical to the sites proteolytically processed by GIII NS2B(H)-NS3(pro). Analysis of the enzymatic activity of recombinant NS2B(H)-NS3(pro) proteases using a model of fluorogenic peptide substrate revealed that the proteolytical processing activity of GIII NS2B(H)-NS3(pro) was significantly higher than that of GI NS2B(H)-NS3(pro). There were eight amino acid variations between GI and GIII NS2B(H)-NS3(pro), which may be responsible for the difference in enzymatic activities between GI and GIII proteases. Therefore, recombinant mutants were generated by exchanging NS2B(H) and NS3(pro) domains between GI and GIII NS2B(H)-NS3(pro) and subjected to protease activity analysis. Substitution of NS2B(H) significantly altered the protease activities, as compared to the parental NS2B(H)-NS3(pro), suggesting that NS2B(H) played an essential role in regulation of NS3(pro) protease activity. To further identify the amino acids responsible for the difference in protease activities, multiple substitution mutants including the individual and combined mutations at the variant residue 55 and 65 of NS2B(H) were generated and subjected to protease activity analysis. Replacement of NS2B-55 and NS2B-65 of GI to GIII significantly increased the enzymatic activity of GI NS2B(H)-NS3(pro) protease, whereas mutation of NS2B-55 and NS2B-65 of GIII to GI remarkably reduced the enzymatic activity of GIII NS2B(H)-NS3(pro) protease. Overall, these data demonstrated that NS2B-55 and NS2B-65 variations in hydrophilic domain of NS2B co-contributed to the difference in NS2B(H)-NS3(pro) protease activities between GI and GIII. These observations gain an insight into the role of NS2B in regulation of NS3 protease activities, which is useful for understanding the replication of JEV GI and GIII viruses."

These genotypes are the primary agents of viral encephalitis in the Asian continent. Genotypes 4 and 5 have remained silent in low-latitude tropical regions since their discovery. From 2009, the hidden genotype 5 suddenly emerged simultaneously in mosquitoes from the Tibetan region of China and those from South Korea in East Asia. The detection of genotype 5 of JEV in these mosquitoes was associated with cases of viral encephalitis in the local population. Similarly, in 2022, the long-silent genotype 4 of JEV emerged in Australia, resulting in a local outbreak of viral encephalitis that primarily affected adults and caused fatalities. The emergence and outbreaks of genotypes 4 and 5 of JEV present new challenges for the prevention and control of Japanese encephalitis (JE). This study not only analyzes the recent emergence of these new genotypes but also discusses their implications in the development of JE vaccines and laboratory tests for newly emerging JEV infections."

Patients with mCRC receiving regorafenib (n\u2009=\u2009100) were retrospectively assessed and divided into control and preexisting proteinuria (baseline grade of 1-2) groups. The primary endpoint was the development of grade\u2009\u2265\u20092 (grade\u2009\u2265\u20093 in case of baseline grade 2 patients) proteinuria. Propensity score-matching was performed to confirm the robustness of primary analyses. Defined proteinuria occurred in 30.7 and 57.9% of patients in the control and preexisting proteinuria groups, respectively, with significant differences in the all-patient population (P\u2009=\u20090.01). The preexisting proteinuria group exhibited significant defined proteinuria development within 7\u00a0days of regorafenib initiation, grade\u2009\u2265\u20093 symptoms, and treatment suspension owing to proteinuria. Similar results were obtained in the propensity score-matched population. According to multivariate logistic regression analysis, baseline proteinuria was a singular risk factor for defined proteinuria development (adjusted odds ratio; 3.76, 95% confidence interval; 1.45-9.75, P\u2009=\u20090.007). Collectively, our study revealed that patients with preexisting proteinuria develop regorafenib-induced proteinuria degradation."

Due to frequent and increasing use, leading to eventual excretion with body fluids, their residues have been found in hospital and household wastewaters as well as surface water. However, the effects of TKI residues in the environment on aquatic organisms are poorly described. In the present study, we investigated the cytotoxic and genotoxic effects of five selected TKIs, namely erlotinib (ERL), dasatinib (DAS), nilotinib (NIL), regorafenib (REG), and sorafenib (SOR), using the in vitro zebrafish liver cell (ZFL) model. Cytotoxicity was determined using the MTS assay and propidium iodide (PI) live/dead staining by flow cytometry. DAS, SOR, and REG decreased ZFL cell viability dose- and time-dependently, with DAS being the most cytotoxic TKI studied. ERL and NIL did not affect viability at concentrations up to their maximum solubility; however, NIL was the only TKI that significantly decreased the proportion of PI negative cells as determined by the flow cytometry. Cell cycle progression analyses showed that DAS, ERL, REG, and SOR caused the cell cycle arrest of ZFL cells in the G0/G1 phase, with a concomitant decrease of cells in the S-phase fraction. No data could be obtained for NIL due to severe DNA fragmentation. The genotoxic activity of the investigated TKIs was evaluated using comet and cytokinesis block micronucleus (CBMN) assays. The dose-dependent induction of DNA single strand breaks was induced by NIL (\u22652 \u03bcM), DAS (\u22650.006 \u03bcM), and REG (\u22650.8 \u03bcM), with DAS being the most potent. None of the TKIs studied induced micronuclei formation. These results suggest that normal non-target fish liver cells are sensitive to the TKIs studied in a concentration range similar to those previously reported for human cancer cell lines. Although the TKI concentrations that induced adverse effects in exposed ZFL cells are several orders of magnitude higher than those currently expected in the aquatic environment, the observed DNA damage and cell cycle effects suggest that residues of TKIs in the environment may pose a hazard to non-intentionally exposed organisms living in environments contaminated with TKIs."

Patients with severe asthma represent a substantial share of consumption of healthcare resources and hospitalization. Moreover, these patients are at risk of increased morbidity and mortality. Recently, several phenotypes and endotypes of asthma have been identified. The identification of specific subtypes of asthma is fundamental for optimizing the clinical benefit of novel treatments. Although in most patients the disease can be controlled by some combination of pharmacologic agents, in some 5-10% of patients the disease remains uncontrolled. Several monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting pathogenetic molecules (e.g., IgE, IL-5, IL- 5R\u03b1, IL-4, IL-13, TSLP) are currently available or under development for the treatment of different forms of severe type 2 asthma. The identification of diagnostic and predictive biomarkers (e.g., IgE, blood eosinophil count, FeNO, periostin, etc.) has revolutioned the field of targeted therapy in severe asthma. Monoclonal antibodies targeting Th2-driven inflammation are generally safe in adult patients with moderate-to-severe asthma. The long-term safety of these biologics is a relevant issue that should be addressed. Unfortunately, little is known about non-type 2 asthma. Further studies are needed to identify biomarkers to guide targeted therapies of different forms of non-type 2 asthma."

Some herpesviruses persist within dividing cells, putting the viral genome at risk of being lost to the cytoplasm during mitosis because karyokinesis (nuclear division) requires nuclear envelope breakdown. Oncogenic herpesviruses (and papillomaviruses) avoid genome loss during mitosis by tethering their genomes to cellular chromosomes, thereby ensuring viral genome uptake into newly formed nuclei. These viruses use viral proteins with DNA- and chromatin-binding capabilities to physically link viral and cellular genomes together in a process called tethering. The known viral tethering proteins of human papillomavirus (E2), Epstein-Barr virus (EBNA1), and Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (LANA) each contain two independent domains required for genome tethering, one that binds sequence specifically to the viral genome and another that binds to cellular chromatin. This latter domain is called a chromatin tethering domain (CTD). The human cytomegalovirus UL123 gene encodes a CTD that is required for the virus to productively infect dividing fibroblast cells within the S phase of the cell cycle, presumably by tethering the viral genome to cellular chromosomes during mitosis. The CTD-containing UL123 gene product that supports S-phase infections is the IE19 protein. Here, we define two motifs in IE19 required for S-phase infections: an N-terminal triple lysine motif and a C-terminal nucleosome-binding motif within the CTD.IMPORTANCEThe IE19 protein encoded by human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is required for S-phase infection of dividing cells, likely because it tethers the viral genome to cellular chromosomes, thereby allowing them to survive mitosis. The mechanism through which IE19 tethers viral genomes to cellular chromosomes is not understood. For human papillomavirus, Epstein-Barr virus, and Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus, viral genome tethering is required for persistence (latency) and pathogenesis (oncogenesis). Like these viruses, HCMV also achieves latency, and it modulates the properties of glioblastoma multiforme tumors. Therefore, defining the mechanism through which IE19 tethers viral genomes to cellular chromosomes may help us understand, and ultimately combat or control, HCMV latency and oncomodulation."

Major risk factors include peculiar chewing habits, human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and molecular pathways. However, less data is available for this avertible cancer regarding its association with high-risk HPV (HR-HPV) and chewing habits in this region. Therefore, this study was done to determine the prevalence of HR-HPV in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) and its correlation with p16 and chewing habits. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) biopsy specimens of 186 samples were tested for HR-HPV type 16/18 by PCR, followed by p16 immunostaining (IHC) in a subset of cases (n = 50). Appropriate statistical tests were applied to find the association between HR-HPV/p16 and peculiar chewing habits with significance criteria of p<0.05 with 95% CI. HR-HPV (type 16 &18) was present in seven out of 186 cases (3.8%). Of these seven cases, five were positive for HPV16, whereas two were positive for HPV16/18. The overall expression of p16 protein in 50 samples was 38% (n = 19), and among these 19-IHC positive samples, 26% were positive for HR-HPV DNA. No significant association was found between HR-HPV positivity and p16 and chewing habits (p>0.05). It was concluded that HR-HPV prevalence in OSCC was very low in our population, with no statistically significant correlation with p16 and chewing habits. These results suggest the role of HR-HPV as an independent risk factor in OSCC in the local setting."

High-resolution anoscopy (HRA) is an in-clinic procedure to detect precancerous anal lesions and cancer, yet prospective data on factors associated with HRA attendance are lacking. We examined whether anal HPV sampling at home versus in a clinic impacts HRA uptake and assessed HRA acceptability. Methods Sexual and gender minority individuals were randomised to home-based self-sampling or clinical sampling. All were asked to attend in-clinic HRA 1year later. We regressed HRA attendance on study arm using multivariable Poisson regression and assessed HRA acceptability using \u03c7 2 tests. Results A total of 62.8% of 196 participants who engaged in screening attended HRA. Although not significant (P =0.13), a higher proportion of participants who engaged in clinic-based screening attended HRA (68.5%) compared to home-based participants (57.9%). Overall, HRA uptake was higher among participants with anal cytology history (aRR 1.40, 95% CI 1.07-1.82), and lower among participants preferring a versatile anal sex position versus insertive (aRR 0.70, 95% CI 0.53-0.91), but did not differ by race or HIV serostatus. In the clinic arm, persons living with HIV had lower HRA attendance (42.9%) versus HIV-negative participants (73.3%) (P =0.02) and Black non-Hispanic participants had lower HRA attendance (41.7%) than White non-Hispanic participants (73.1%), (P =0.04). No differences in attendance by race or HIV status were observed in the home arm. Conclusions HRA uptake differed significantly by race and HIV status in the clinic arm but not the home arm."

In recent years, with a better understanding of the effectiveness and safety of vaccinations, many recommendations have been developed for administering vaccines to adults. Countless physiological changes occur during pregnancy, including those affecting the immune system. Pregnant women are at increased risk of developing infections and resulting complications. According to research, vaccines are immunogenic and safe for pregnant women. Pregnancy is not an absolute contraindication to vaccination. After administration of vaccines to pregnant women, the concentration of antibodies increases, which can be transferred to the child in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy and provide protection in the first months of life. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), guidelines of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology (ACOG) unanimously recommend vaccination of pregnant women if a safe vaccine is available and there is a risk of exposure of the woman to a disease that threatens herself or her developing baby. In everyday clinical practice, medical professionals should provide their patients with the necessary information on vaccinations, which may contribute to greater awareness and implementation of vaccinations. This article aims to review current global recommendations for the vaccination of pregnant and breastfeeding women, including against the Omicron variants of SARS-CoV-2."

The key characteristic of this disease is the birth of persistently infected (PI) lambs which, after surviving transplacental infection, are born antibody negative, yet virus positive, and thus shed the virus for their entire life and are the primary source of spread within a flock. The cornerstones of BDV control are detection and elimination of PI animals, biosecurity measures to prevent re-infection, and surveillance programs. Recommendations for the control of BDV in sheep are centred around the approach to bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV), the prominent cattle pestivirus species, due to a lack of specific research into BDV control and elimination. In this study, two aspects of a BDV control program were investigated: the effectiveness of the BVDV vaccine, Pestigard\u00ae, and the rate of seroconversion in a flock deliberately exposed to known PI lambs. The vaccine appeared to be safe, and the optimal dose was the full cattle dose (2\u2009mL). While vaccination induced high virus neutralising titres to BVDV when administered as either a quarter, half or full dose registered for cattle, the BDV titres achieved were low and unlikely to prevent transplacental infection. In a second study, after exposure of between 2 and 15\u2009days exposure to two PI lambs in confined conditions, only 3 of 66 previously na\u00efve sheep demonstrated seroconversion. This demonstrated a very low rate of transmission and suggested that deliberate exposure to PI lambs at low-risk times for less than 15\u2009days was not likely to be an effective means of achieving seroconversion throughout a flock and, therefore, not provide protection against BDV challenge during gestation."

Vaccination can reduce the burden of RSV-related respiratory disease, with previous studies showing its substantial medical and financial burden in Jordan. However, pregnant women may exhibit hesitancy to get vaccinated due to concerns about potential risks to themselves or their fetuses. This study aimed to assess the acceptance of the RSV vaccine among young females and identify the determinants influencing their decision using a newly constructed instrument. A survey instrument was developed and validated, comprising 26 items to measure RSV vaccine acceptance. A cross-sectional study design was employed, with data collection from a sample of females aged 18 to 45 residing in Jordan during 5-6 July 2023, using a convenient approach via an online distributed questionnaire. The final study sample comprised 315 respondents, with 67.6% who have heard of RSV before the study. If the vaccine was safe, effective, and provided freely, 70.2% showed willingness to get the RSV vaccine, 15.2% resisted, and 14.6% were hesitant. Principal component analysis identified six internally consistent sub-scales with the following suggested themes: Advice, Burden, Conspiracy, Dangers, Efficiency, and Fear, comprising 21 items collectively as assigned as the \"ABCDEF\" scale for RSV vaccine acceptance. RSV vaccine acceptance in this study was associated with the advice and fear constructs. The validated survey instrument successfully captured important determinants of RSV vaccine acceptance among young females. RSV vaccine promotion efforts should focus on the following: enhancing vaccine education, improving trust in healthcare institutions and providers, reducing burdens through resolving cost issues and focusing on the role of social support, addressing safety concerns, and tailoring communication strategies to effectively promote the benefits of the vaccine. These insights can inform public health policies and interventions aiming to promote RSV vaccination and mitigate the burden of RSV-related diseases among infants. Follow-up studies are recommended with pregnant women as the target group to assess their attitude towards RSV vaccination and to confirm the validity of the conceived ABCDEF survey instrument."

RB51-specific antibodies were detected and quantified using a CFT based on the RB51 antigen. Vaccinated animals showed a positive serological reaction following each vaccine injection, but titers and the duration of the antibody differed among animals. For 36 weeks after booster vaccination, the comparison of CFT values between vaccinated and control groups remained constantly significant. Afterwards, antibody titers decreased. No relevant changes in antibody response were recorded during pregnancy or lactation. In conclusion, results indicated that the vaccination schedule applied is safe and allows for vaccinated and unvaccinated controls to be discriminated between for up to 8 months after booster vaccination."

The prevailing Th2 profile in advanced CTCL underscores the significance of understanding IL-4/IL-13 expression dynamics from the early stages of disease, as a shift from Th1 to Th2 may explain CTCL progression. Targeted agents blocking key cytokines of type 2 immunity are established therapeutics in atopic disorders and have a promising therapeutic potential in CTCL, given their involvement in cutaneous symptoms and their contribution to the pathogenesis of disease.

Clinical trials and case reports are required to shed light on novel uses of medications in various diseases, and ongoing research into the role of IL-4/IL-13 axis blockers in CTCL therapy might not only improve the management of disease-related pruritus but also provide in-depth insights on the pathophysiologic mechanisms of CTCL."

Fewer than 20% of patients only survive beyond five years from diagnosis. CRC is a highly preventable disease if diagnosed at the early stage of malignancy. Several screening methods like endoscopy (like colonoscopy; gold standard), imaging examination [computed tomographic colonography (CTC)], guaiac-based fecal occult blood (gFOBT), immunochemical test from faeces, and stool DNA test are available with different levels of sensitivity and specificity. The available screening methods are associated with certain drawbacks like invasiveness, cost, or sensitivity. In recent years, computer-aided systems-based screening, diagnosis, and treatment have been very promising in the early-stage detection and diagnosis of CRC cases. Artificial intelligence (AI) is an enormously in-demand, cost-effective technology, that uses various tools machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) to screen, diagnose, and stage, and has great potential to treat CRC. Moreover, different ML algorithms and neural networks [artificial neural network (ANN), k-nearest neighbors (KNN), and support vector machines (SVMs)] have been deployed to predict precise and personalized treatment options. This review examines and summarizes different ML and DL models used for therapeutic intervention in CRC cancer along with the gap and challenges for AI."

Since the publication of European Society of GI Endoscopy guidelines on the use of CCE, there has been a significant increase in comparative studies on the diagnostic yield of CCE. This paper discusses CCE2 in further detail. It explains newly developed colon capsule system and the current status on the use of CCE, it also provides a comprehensive summary of systematic reviews on the implementation of CCE in colorectal cancer screening from a methodological perspective. Patients with ulcerative colitis can benefit from CCE2 in terms of assessing mucosal inflammation. As part of this review, performance of CCE2 for assessing disease severity in ulcerative colitis is compared with colonoscopy. Finally, an assessment if CCE can become a cost-effective clinical service overall."

CT colonography uses minimally invasive evaluation of colorectum and has better patient acceptance, which appears to be a promising screening modality to improve low colorectal cancer screening rate. This study investigated the utilization patterns of CT colonography and factors associated with its use among U.S. adult population. This retrospective cross-sectional study analyzed the National Health Interview Survey 2015 and 2018. U.S. adults ages 45 or older without a history of colorectal cancer were included. Survey design-adjusted Wald F tests were used to compare the utilization of CT colonography during the study period. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify the predictors of CT colonography among individual socioeconomic and health-related characteristics. The study sample included 34,768 individuals representing 129,430,319 U.S. adult population ages 45 or older. The overall utilization of CT colonography increased from 0.79% in 2015 to 1.33% in 2018 (<i>P</i> < 0.001). 54.5% study participants reported being up-to-date on recommended colorectal cancer screening; of those, 1.8% used CT colonography. Compared with individuals ages 65+, those ages 45-49 years were 2.08 times (OR, 2.08, 95% confidence interval, 1.01-4.35) more likely to use CT colonography. Socioeconomically disadvantaged characteristics (e.g., racial/ethnic minority, low income, publicly funded insurance) were associated with a greater likelihood of CT colonography. This study demonstrated an increasing trend in utilization of CT colonography for colorectal cancer screening in U.S. adults. Younger individuals, racial/ethnic minorities, or those with lower income appear to have a higher CT colonography utilization. PREVENTION RELEVANCE: Although computed tomographic (CT) colonography has been proved to be cost-effective and have better patient acceptance, its overall utilization for colorectal cancer (CRC) screening is low (<1.4%) among US adults aged 45+ in 2018. More efforts are needed to implement strategies to increase CT colonography for effective CRC prevention."

Materials and Methods Observed participation rates and screening costs from the Colonoscopy or Colonography for Screening, or COCOS, trial were used in a microsimulation model to estimate costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained with colonoscopy and CT colonography screening. For both tests, the authors determined optimal age range and screening interval combinations assuming a 100% participation rate. Assuming observed participation for these combinations, the cost-effectiveness of both tests was compared. Extracolonic findings were not included because long-term follow-up data are lacking. Results The participation rates for colonoscopy and CT colonography were 21.5% (1276 of 5924 invitees) and 33.6% (982 of 2920 invitees), respectively. Colonoscopy was more cost-effective in the screening strategies with one or two lifetime screenings, whereas CT colonography was more cost-effective in strategies with more lifetime screenings. CT colonography was the preferred test for willingness-to-pay-thresholds of \u20ac3200 per QALY gained and higher, which is lower than the Dutch willingness-to-pay threshold of \u20ac20 000. With equal participation, colonoscopy was the preferred test independent of willingness-to-pay thresholds. The findings were robust for most of the sensitivity analyses, except with regard to relative screening costs and subsequent participation. Conclusion Because of the higher participation rates, CT colonography screening for colorectal cancer is more cost-effective than colonoscopy screening. The implementation of CT colonography screening requires previous satisfactory resolution to the question as to how best to deal with extracolonic findings. <sup>\u00a9</sup> RSNA, 2018 Online supplemental material is available for this article."

The effectiveness of screening estimated by discounted life years gained (LYGs) compared to no screening, differed considerably between the studies. Despite these differences, all studies consistently emphasized that screening for CRC was cost-effective compared with no screening for each of the recognized screening strategies. Newer technologies for colorectal cancer screening, including computed tomographic colonography (CTC), faecal DNA test, and Pillcam Colon are less invasive and accurate, however, they are not cost-effective, as their cost was higher than all other established screening strategies.

While the role of CTC as a primary test for population screening of CRC is under investigation, the fecal occult blood test (FOBT) has been recommended for population screening of CRC in Europe. Subjects with positive FOBT are invited to undergo total colonoscopy, which has some critical issues, such as suboptimal compliance, contraindications and the possibility of an incomplete exploration of the colon. Based on available data, the integration of CTC in FOBT-based population screening programs for CRC may fall into three scenarios. First, CTC is recommended in FOBT-positive subjects when colonoscopy is refused, incomplete or contraindicated. For these indications CTC should replace double-contrast barium enema. Second, conversely, CTC is not currently recommended as a second-level examination prior to colonoscopy in all FOBT-positive subjects, as this strategy is most probably not cost-effective. Finally, CTC may be considered instead of colonoscopy for surveillance after adenoma removal, but specific studies are needed."

Additionally, analyses of the blood-brain barrier were conducted using western blotting, and neuroinflammation was assessed using ELISA. Another set of animals was evaluated on postnatal days 3, 6, 9, and 12 for neurodevelopment by observing the developmental milestones. Our results revealed hippocampal atrophy in ZIKV animals, in addition to changes in the blood-brain barrier structure and pro-inflammatory cytokines expression increase. Regarding neurodevelopment, a delay in important reflexes during the neonatal period in ZIKV animals was observed.

ZIKV is a virus transmitted by arthropods (arboviruses), mainly by Aedes mosquitoes. ZIKV can also be transmitted to humans through mechanisms other than vector infection such as sexual intercourse, blood transfusions, and mother-to-child transmission. The latter mode of transmission can give rise to a severe clinical form called congenital Zika syndrome (CZS), which can result in spontaneous abortion or serious pathological alterations in the fetus such as microcephaly or neurological and orofacial anomalies. In this study, beside a succinct overview of the etiological, microbiological, and epidemiological aspects and modes of transmission of Zika virus infections, we have focused our attention on the pathogenetic and histopathological aspects in pregnancy and the pathogenetic and molecular mechanisms that can determine microcephaly, and consequently the clinical alterations, typical of the fetus and newborns, in a subject affected by CZS."

Viral RNA was detected through qRT-PCR in a serum sample. In addition, the seroconversion of anti-Zika IgM and IgG antibodies was detected in repeated blood samples. Subsequently, the virus was isolated from the C6/36 cell line. The detected ZIKV belonged to the African lineage, the Nigerian sublineage. The strains with the closest sequences were isolated from mosquitoes in Senegal in 2011 and 2015.

The recent COVID-19 pandemic has increased the interest in understanding the consequences of infections in offspring's development. This systematic review explores whether maternal gestational viral respiratory infections are associated with neurodevelopmental deviations in children below 10 years-old. The search was conducted in Pubmed, PsychInfo and Web of Science databases. 13 articles were revised, including information about maternal infection (Influenza, SARS-CoV-2 and unspecified respiratory infections) and offspring's neurodevelopment (global development, specific functions, temperament and behavioral/emotional aspects). Controversial results were reported regarding maternal respiratory infections during pregnancy and infants' neurodevelopment. Maternal infections seem to be associated with subtle alterations in some offspring's developmental subdomains, as early motor development, and attentional, behavioral/emotional minor problems. Further studies are needed to determine the impact of other psychosocial confounding factors."

The Zika virus (ZIKV) outbreak in Brazil has been the cause of congenital Zika syndrome (CZS), with devastating consequences such as microcephaly in newborns. Herein, we analyzed the impact of maternal overweight/obesity on the antiviral factors' expression in the placental tissue of Zika-infected mothers. We accessed placentas from women with and without obesity from 34 public health units (S\u00e3o Paulo) and from Zika-infected mothers with and without obesity from the Clinical Cohort Study of ZIKV pregnant women (Rio de Janeiro, Brazil). We first verified that obesity, without infection, did not alter the constitutive transcriptional expression of antiviral factors or IFN type I/III expression. Interestingly, obesity, when associated with ZIKV infection, showed a decreased transcriptional expression of RIG-I and IFIH1 (MDA-5 protein precursor gene). At the protein level, we also verified a decreased RIG-I and IRF-3 expression in the decidual placenta from the Zika-infected obese group, regardless of microcephaly. This finding shows, for the first time, that obesity associated with ZIKV infection leads to an impaired type I IFN downstream signaling pathway in the maternal-fetal interface."

In this review, we characterize decidual and placental immunity during maternal viral (co)-infection with HIV-1, human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), and Zika virus. We discuss placental immunology, clinical presentation, and epidemiology, before characterizing host susceptibility and cellular tropism, and how the three viruses gain access into specific placental target cells. We describe current knowledge on host-viral interactions with decidual and stromal human placental macrophages or Hofbauer cells, trophoblasts including extra villous trophoblasts, T cells, and decidual natural killer (dNK) cells. These clinically significant viral infections elicit both innate and adaptive immune responses to control replication. However, the three viruses either during mono- or co-infection (HIV-1 and HCMV) escape detection to initiate placental inflammation associated with viral transmission to the developing fetus. Aside from congenital or perinatal infection, other adverse pregnancy outcomes include preterm labor and spontaneous abortion. In addition, maternal HIV-1 and HCMV co-infection are associated with impaired fetal and infant immunity in postnatal life and poor clinical outcomes during childhood in exposed infants, even in the absence of vertical transmission of HIV-1. Given the rapidly expanding numbers of HIV-1-exposed uninfected infants and children globally, further research is urgently needed on neonatal immune programming during maternal mono-and co-infection. This review therefore includes sections on current knowledge gaps that may prompt future research directions. These gaps reflect an emerging but poorly characterized field. Their significance and potential investigation is underscored by the fact that although viral infections result in adverse consequences in both mother and developing fetus/newborn, antiviral and immunomodulatory therapies can improve clinical outcomes in the dyad."

In many cases these outbreaks have had considerable perinatal health consequences including increased risk of preterm delivery (e.g., influenza, measles, and COVID-19), and the delivery of low birth weight or small for gestational age babies (e.g., influenza, COVID-19). Furthermore, severe perinatal outcomes including perinatal and infant death are a known consequence of multiple infectious diseases (e.g., Ebola virus disease, Zika virus disease, pertussis, and measles). In addition to vaccination during pregnancy (where possible), pregnant women, are provided some level of protection from the adverse effects of infection through community-level application of evidence-based transmission-control methods. This review demonstrates that it takes almost 2 years for the perinatal impacts of an infectious disease outbreak to be reported. However, many infectious disease outbreaks between 2010 and 2020 have no associated pregnancy data reported in the scientific literature, or pregnancy data is reported in the form of case-studies only. This lack of systematic data collection and reporting has a negative impact on our understanding of these diseases and the implications they may have for pregnant women and their unborn infants. Monitoring perinatal health is an essential aspect of national and global healthcare strategies as perinatal life has a critical impact on early life mortality as well as possible effects on later life health. The unpredictable nature of emerging infections and the potential for adverse perinatal outcomes necessitate that we thoroughly assess pregnancy and perinatal health implications of disease outbreaks and their public health interventions in tandem with outbreak response efforts. Disease surveillance programs should incorporate perinatal health monitoring and health systems around the world should endeavor to continuously collect perinatal health data in order to quickly update pregnancy care protocols as needed."

ZIKV has a unique ability to use the host machinery to promote viral replication in a tissue-specific manner, resulting in characteristic pathological disorders. Recent studies have proposed that the host ubiquitin system acts as a major determinant of ZIKV tropism by providing the virus with an enhanced ability to enter new cells. In addition, ZIKV has developed mechanisms to evade the host immune response, thereby allowing the establishment of viral persistence and enhancing viral pathogenesis.

This resulted in forty-five human cases, including seven deaths, and the identification of JEV infection in over 80 commercial piggeries. <b><i>Materials and Methods:</i></b> We collected mosquitoes which were trapped using CO<sub>2</sub>-baited light traps deployed near piggeries reporting disease or in regions linked to human cases in the Wide Bay region in the state of Queensland. Mosquitoes from four traps yielded JEV RNA by real-time RT-PCR. Pools containing RNA positive mosquitoes were inoculated onto mosquito cell monolayers. <b><i>Discussion:</i></b> A single isolate of JEV was obtained from a pool of mixed mosquito species. Near whole genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of the JEV isolate demonstrated its high genomic relatedness with JEV GIV pig sequences sampled from Queensland and the state of New South Wales in 2022. <b><i>Conclusion:</i></b> We report the first isolation of JEV GIV from mosquitoes collected in Australia. With only a few JEV GIV isolates available globally, the isolate we report will be essential for future research of JEV host interactions, evolution and disease markers, and development of effective therapies, vaccines, diagnostic assays, and mosquito control strategies."

Fortunately, the development of vaccines has enabled effective defense against JE. However, re-emerging genotype V (GV) JEV poses a challenge as current vaccines are genotype III (GIII)-based and provide suboptimal protection. Given the isolation of GV JEVs from Malaysia, China, and the Republic of Korea, there is a concern about the potential for a broader outbreak. Under the hypothesis that a GV-based vaccine is necessary for effective defense against GV JEV, we developed a pentameric recombinant antigen using cholera toxin B as a scaffold and mucosal adjuvant, which was conjugated with the E protein domain III of GV by genetic fusion. This GV-based vaccine antigen induced a more effective immune response in mice against GV JEV isolates compared to GIII-based antigen and efficiently protected animals from lethal challenges. Furthermore, a bivalent vaccine approach, inoculating simultaneously with GIII- and GV-based antigens, showed protective efficacy against both GIII and GV JEVs. This strategy presents a promising avenue for comprehensive protection in regions facing the threat of diverse JEV genotypes, including both prevalent GIII and GI as well as emerging GV strains."

Since past decade, a rise in chikungunya (CHIK) cases has been occurring, which is a reported etiology of AES. However, the burden of chikungunya virus (CHIKV) among pediatric AES (pAES) is unknown from E-UP. We included 238 hospitalized pAES cases. The presence of IgM antibodies for CHIKV, and Dengue virus (DENV) was tested, and RT-PCR was performed for CHIKV and DENV in serologically confirmed CHIKV and DENV pAES cases. Positive samples were sequenced using Sangers sequencing. Further, to check for co-infection, IgM antibodies for other AES etiologies including Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), Leptospira and Orientia tsutsugamushi (OT) in serum were also investigated. IgM ELISA demonstrated 5.04% (12) positivity for CHIKV. Among CHIKV IgM positive, 3 (25%, 3/12) pAES patients died. CHIKV genome was detected in 3 pAES specimens. Among which, 2 CHIKV cases were also positive for OT DNA. Partially sequenced CHIKV were genotyped as ECSA. The overall finding indicates evidence of CHIKV infection with high case fatality among pAES patients from E-UP. This study advocates constant serological and molecular surveillance of CHIKV in AES endemic regions of India."

Consequently, increasing VLPs production is important and can be achieved by optimizing expression plasmids and cell culture conditions. While attempting to express genotype III (GIII) Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) VLPs containing the G104H mutation in the envelope (E) protein, we failed to generate VLPs in COS-1 cells. However, VLPs production was restored by cultivating plasmid-transfected cells at a lower temperature, specifically 28\u00a0\u00b0C. Furthermore, we observed that the enhancement in JEV VLPs production was independent of amino acid mutations in the E protein. The optimal condition for JEV VLPs production in plasmid-transfected COS-1 cells consisted of an initial culture at 37\u00a0\u00b0C for 6\u00a0h, followed by a shift to 28\u00a0\u00b0C (37/28\u00a0\u00b0C) for cultivation. Under 37/28\u00a0\u00b0C cultivation conditions, flavivirus VLPs production significantly increased in various mammalian cell lines regardless of whether its expression was transiently transfected or clonally selected cells. Remarkably, clonally selected cell lines expressing flavivirus VLPs consistently achieved yields exceeding 1\u00a0\u03bcg/ml. Binding affinity analyses using monoclonal antibodies revealed similar binding patterns for VLPs of genotype I (GI) JEV, GIII JEV, West Nile virus (WNV), and dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV-2) produced under both 37\u00a0\u00b0C or 37/28\u00a0\u00b0C cultivation conditions. In summary, our study demonstrated that the production of flavivirus VLPs can be significantly improved under 37/28\u00a0\u00b0C cultivation conditions without affecting the conformational structure of the E protein. KEYPOINTS: \u2022 Low-temperature culture (37/28\u00a0\u00b0C) enhances production of flavivirus VLPs. \u2022 Flavivirus VLPs consistently achieved yields exceeding 1\u00a0\u03bcg/ml. \u2022 37/28\u00a0\u00b0C cultivation did not alter the structure of flavivirus VLPs."

However, most of JEV positive reports in birds were based on molecular detection, with few viruses isolated from clinical cases. In this study, one JEV strain, designated duck/2022-SD-1, was first isolated and identified from blood samples of ducks in 2022 in Shandong province of China. The JEV duck/2022-SD-1 strain was classified into genotype I cluster and shared 96.5 to 99.5 % nucleotide sequence identity with other GI JEV strains. Biological characteristics revealed that duck/2022-SD-1 possessed similar replication ability to a virulent strain Beijing/2020-1. Based on the amino acid identity comparison of E protein, amino acid sites responsible for JEV virulence were conserved between duck/2022-SD-1 and other virulence strains. Through virulence assays in mice, we further determined that duck/2022-SD-1 was a highly virulent JEV strain with highly neuroinvasive in mice, which is similar to the virulence of another virulent strain Beijing/2020-1. Thus, the potential threat of JEV strains originating from domestic birds should be brought to people's attention."

Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), a flavivirus, is responsible for JE. In Asia, Genotype I (GI) has emerged as the dominant strain, replacing Genotype III (GIII). However, no clinically approved drug is available to treat JEV infection, and currently available commercial vaccines derived from JEV GIII strains provide only partial protection against GI. Utilizing a reverse genetics system, this study attempted to produce a novel chimeric JEV strain with high efficacy against JEV GI. Accordingly, a GI/GIII intertypic recombinant strain, namely SA14-GI env, was generated by substituting the E region of the GIII SA14-14-2 strain with that of the GI strain, K05GS. The neurovirulence of the mutant virus was significantly reduced in mice. Analysis of the immunogenicity of the chimeric virus revealed that it induced neutralizing antibodies against JEV GI in mice, and the protective efficacy of SA14-GI env was higher than that of SA14-14-2. These findings suggest that SA14-GI env may be a safe and effective live-attenuated vaccine candidate against JEV GI."

The N-terminal protease domain (180 residues) of NS3 (NS3(pro)) interacts directly with a central 40-amino acid hydrophilic domain of NS2B (NS2B(H)) to form an active serine protease. In this study, the recombinant NS2B(H)-NS3(pro) proteases were prepared in <i>E. coli</i> and used to compare the enzymatic activity between genotype I (GI) and III (GIII) NS2B-NS3 proteases. The GI NS2B(H)-NS3(pro) was able to cleave the sites at internal C, NS2A/NS2B, NS2B/NS3 and NS3/NS4A junctions that were identical to the sites proteolytically processed by GIII NS2B(H)-NS3(pro). Analysis of the enzymatic activity of recombinant NS2B(H)-NS3(pro) proteases using a model of fluorogenic peptide substrate revealed that the proteolytical processing activity of GIII NS2B(H)-NS3(pro) was significantly higher than that of GI NS2B(H)-NS3(pro). There were eight amino acid variations between GI and GIII NS2B(H)-NS3(pro), which may be responsible for the difference in enzymatic activities between GI and GIII proteases. Therefore, recombinant mutants were generated by exchanging NS2B(H) and NS3(pro) domains between GI and GIII NS2B(H)-NS3(pro) and subjected to protease activity analysis. Substitution of NS2B(H) significantly altered the protease activities, as compared to the parental NS2B(H)-NS3(pro), suggesting that NS2B(H) played an essential role in regulation of NS3(pro) protease activity. To further identify the amino acids responsible for the difference in protease activities, multiple substitution mutants including the individual and combined mutations at the variant residue 55 and 65 of NS2B(H) were generated and subjected to protease activity analysis. Replacement of NS2B-55 and NS2B-65 of GI to GIII significantly increased the enzymatic activity of GI NS2B(H)-NS3(pro) protease, whereas mutation of NS2B-55 and NS2B-65 of GIII to GI remarkably reduced the enzymatic activity of GIII NS2B(H)-NS3(pro) protease. Overall, these data demonstrated that NS2B-55 and NS2B-65 variations in hydrophilic domain of NS2B co-contributed to the difference in NS2B(H)-NS3(pro) protease activities between GI and GIII. These observations gain an insight into the role of NS2B in regulation of NS3 protease activities, which is useful for understanding the replication of JEV GI and GIII viruses."

These genotypes are the primary agents of viral encephalitis in the Asian continent. Genotypes 4 and 5 have remained silent in low-latitude tropical regions since their discovery. From 2009, the hidden genotype 5 suddenly emerged simultaneously in mosquitoes from the Tibetan region of China and those from South Korea in East Asia. The detection of genotype 5 of JEV in these mosquitoes was associated with cases of viral encephalitis in the local population. Similarly, in 2022, the long-silent genotype 4 of JEV emerged in Australia, resulting in a local outbreak of viral encephalitis that primarily affected adults and caused fatalities. The emergence and outbreaks of genotypes 4 and 5 of JEV present new challenges for the prevention and control of Japanese encephalitis (JE). This study not only analyzes the recent emergence of these new genotypes but also discusses their implications in the development of JE vaccines and laboratory tests for newly emerging JEV infections."

Due to frequent and increasing use, leading to eventual excretion with body fluids, their residues have been found in hospital and household wastewaters as well as surface water. However, the effects of TKI residues in the environment on aquatic organisms are poorly described. In the present study, we investigated the cytotoxic and genotoxic effects of five selected TKIs, namely erlotinib (ERL), dasatinib (DAS), nilotinib (NIL), regorafenib (REG), and sorafenib (SOR), using the in vitro zebrafish liver cell (ZFL) model. Cytotoxicity was determined using the MTS assay and propidium iodide (PI) live/dead staining by flow cytometry. DAS, SOR, and REG decreased ZFL cell viability dose- and time-dependently, with DAS being the most cytotoxic TKI studied. ERL and NIL did not affect viability at concentrations up to their maximum solubility; however, NIL was the only TKI that significantly decreased the proportion of PI negative cells as determined by the flow cytometry. Cell cycle progression analyses showed that DAS, ERL, REG, and SOR caused the cell cycle arrest of ZFL cells in the G0/G1 phase, with a concomitant decrease of cells in the S-phase fraction. No data could be obtained for NIL due to severe DNA fragmentation. The genotoxic activity of the investigated TKIs was evaluated using comet and cytokinesis block micronucleus (CBMN) assays. The dose-dependent induction of DNA single strand breaks was induced by NIL (\u22652 \u03bcM), DAS (\u22650.006 \u03bcM), and REG (\u22650.8 \u03bcM), with DAS being the most potent. None of the TKIs studied induced micronuclei formation. These results suggest that normal non-target fish liver cells are sensitive to the TKIs studied in a concentration range similar to those previously reported for human cancer cell lines. Although the TKI concentrations that induced adverse effects in exposed ZFL cells are several orders of magnitude higher than those currently expected in the aquatic environment, the observed DNA damage and cell cycle effects suggest that residues of TKIs in the environment may pose a hazard to non-intentionally exposed organisms living in environments contaminated with TKIs."

Patients with severe asthma represent a substantial share of consumption of healthcare resources and hospitalization. Moreover, these patients are at risk of increased morbidity and mortality. Recently, several phenotypes and endotypes of asthma have been identified. The identification of specific subtypes of asthma is fundamental for optimizing the clinical benefit of novel treatments. Although in most patients the disease can be controlled by some combination of pharmacologic agents, in some 5-10% of patients the disease remains uncontrolled. Several monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting pathogenetic molecules (e.g., IgE, IL-5, IL- 5R\u03b1, IL-4, IL-13, TSLP) are currently available or under development for the treatment of different forms of severe type 2 asthma. The identification of diagnostic and predictive biomarkers (e.g., IgE, blood eosinophil count, FeNO, periostin, etc.) has revolutioned the field of targeted therapy in severe asthma. Monoclonal antibodies targeting Th2-driven inflammation are generally safe in adult patients with moderate-to-severe asthma. The long-term safety of these biologics is a relevant issue that should be addressed. Unfortunately, little is known about non-type 2 asthma. Further studies are needed to identify biomarkers to guide targeted therapies of different forms of non-type 2 asthma."

Some herpesviruses persist within dividing cells, putting the viral genome at risk of being lost to the cytoplasm during mitosis because karyokinesis (nuclear division) requires nuclear envelope breakdown. Oncogenic herpesviruses (and papillomaviruses) avoid genome loss during mitosis by tethering their genomes to cellular chromosomes, thereby ensuring viral genome uptake into newly formed nuclei. These viruses use viral proteins with DNA- and chromatin-binding capabilities to physically link viral and cellular genomes together in a process called tethering. The known viral tethering proteins of human papillomavirus (E2), Epstein-Barr virus (EBNA1), and Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (LANA) each contain two independent domains required for genome tethering, one that binds sequence specifically to the viral genome and another that binds to cellular chromatin. This latter domain is called a chromatin tethering domain (CTD). The human cytomegalovirus UL123 gene encodes a CTD that is required for the virus to productively infect dividing fibroblast cells within the S phase of the cell cycle, presumably by tethering the viral genome to cellular chromosomes during mitosis. The CTD-containing UL123 gene product that supports S-phase infections is the IE19 protein. Here, we define two motifs in IE19 required for S-phase infections: an N-terminal triple lysine motif and a C-terminal nucleosome-binding motif within the CTD.IMPORTANCEThe IE19 protein encoded by human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is required for S-phase infection of dividing cells, likely because it tethers the viral genome to cellular chromosomes, thereby allowing them to survive mitosis. The mechanism through which IE19 tethers viral genomes to cellular chromosomes is not understood. For human papillomavirus, Epstein-Barr virus, and Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus, viral genome tethering is required for persistence (latency) and pathogenesis (oncogenesis). Like these viruses, HCMV also achieves latency, and it modulates the properties of glioblastoma multiforme tumors. Therefore, defining the mechanism through which IE19 tethers viral genomes to cellular chromosomes may help us understand, and ultimately combat or control, HCMV latency and oncomodulation."

Major risk factors include peculiar chewing habits, human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and molecular pathways. However, less data is available for this avertible cancer regarding its association with high-risk HPV (HR-HPV) and chewing habits in this region. Therefore, this study was done to determine the prevalence of HR-HPV in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) and its correlation with p16 and chewing habits. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) biopsy specimens of 186 samples were tested for HR-HPV type 16/18 by PCR, followed by p16 immunostaining (IHC) in a subset of cases (n = 50). Appropriate statistical tests were applied to find the association between HR-HPV/p16 and peculiar chewing habits with significance criteria of p<0.05 with 95% CI. HR-HPV (type 16 &18) was present in seven out of 186 cases (3.8%). Of these seven cases, five were positive for HPV16, whereas two were positive for HPV16/18. The overall expression of p16 protein in 50 samples was 38% (n = 19), and among these 19-IHC positive samples, 26% were positive for HR-HPV DNA. No significant association was found between HR-HPV positivity and p16 and chewing habits (p>0.05). It was concluded that HR-HPV prevalence in OSCC was very low in our population, with no statistically significant correlation with p16 and chewing habits. These results suggest the role of HR-HPV as an independent risk factor in OSCC in the local setting."

High-resolution anoscopy (HRA) is an in-clinic procedure to detect precancerous anal lesions and cancer, yet prospective data on factors associated with HRA attendance are lacking. We examined whether anal HPV sampling at home versus in a clinic impacts HRA uptake and assessed HRA acceptability. Methods Sexual and gender minority individuals were randomised to home-based self-sampling or clinical sampling. All were asked to attend in-clinic HRA 1year later. We regressed HRA attendance on study arm using multivariable Poisson regression and assessed HRA acceptability using \u03c7 2 tests. Results A total of 62.8% of 196 participants who engaged in screening attended HRA. Although not significant (P =0.13), a higher proportion of participants who engaged in clinic-based screening attended HRA (68.5%) compared to home-based participants (57.9%). Overall, HRA uptake was higher among participants with anal cytology history (aRR 1.40, 95% CI 1.07-1.82), and lower among participants preferring a versatile anal sex position versus insertive (aRR 0.70, 95% CI 0.53-0.91), but did not differ by race or HIV serostatus. In the clinic arm, persons living with HIV had lower HRA attendance (42.9%) versus HIV-negative participants (73.3%) (P =0.02) and Black non-Hispanic participants had lower HRA attendance (41.7%) than White non-Hispanic participants (73.1%), (P =0.04). No differences in attendance by race or HIV status were observed in the home arm. Conclusions HRA uptake differed significantly by race and HIV status in the clinic arm but not the home arm."

In recent years, with a better understanding of the effectiveness and safety of vaccinations, many recommendations have been developed for administering vaccines to adults. Countless physiological changes occur during pregnancy, including those affecting the immune system. Pregnant women are at increased risk of developing infections and resulting complications. According to research, vaccines are immunogenic and safe for pregnant women. Pregnancy is not an absolute contraindication to vaccination. After administration of vaccines to pregnant women, the concentration of antibodies increases, which can be transferred to the child in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy and provide protection in the first months of life. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), guidelines of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology (ACOG) unanimously recommend vaccination of pregnant women if a safe vaccine is available and there is a risk of exposure of the woman to a disease that threatens herself or her developing baby. In everyday clinical practice, medical professionals should provide their patients with the necessary information on vaccinations, which may contribute to greater awareness and implementation of vaccinations. This article aims to review current global recommendations for the vaccination of pregnant and breastfeeding women, including against the Omicron variants of SARS-CoV-2."

The key characteristic of this disease is the birth of persistently infected (PI) lambs which, after surviving transplacental infection, are born antibody negative, yet virus positive, and thus shed the virus for their entire life and are the primary source of spread within a flock. The cornerstones of BDV control are detection and elimination of PI animals, biosecurity measures to prevent re-infection, and surveillance programs. Recommendations for the control of BDV in sheep are centred around the approach to bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV), the prominent cattle pestivirus species, due to a lack of specific research into BDV control and elimination. In this study, two aspects of a BDV control program were investigated: the effectiveness of the BVDV vaccine, Pestigard\u00ae, and the rate of seroconversion in a flock deliberately exposed to known PI lambs. The vaccine appeared to be safe, and the optimal dose was the full cattle dose (2\u2009mL). While vaccination induced high virus neutralising titres to BVDV when administered as either a quarter, half or full dose registered for cattle, the BDV titres achieved were low and unlikely to prevent transplacental infection. In a second study, after exposure of between 2 and 15\u2009days exposure to two PI lambs in confined conditions, only 3 of 66 previously na\u00efve sheep demonstrated seroconversion. This demonstrated a very low rate of transmission and suggested that deliberate exposure to PI lambs at low-risk times for less than 15\u2009days was not likely to be an effective means of achieving seroconversion throughout a flock and, therefore, not provide protection against BDV challenge during gestation."

Vaccination can reduce the burden of RSV-related respiratory disease, with previous studies showing its substantial medical and financial burden in Jordan. However, pregnant women may exhibit hesitancy to get vaccinated due to concerns about potential risks to themselves or their fetuses. This study aimed to assess the acceptance of the RSV vaccine among young females and identify the determinants influencing their decision using a newly constructed instrument. A survey instrument was developed and validated, comprising 26 items to measure RSV vaccine acceptance. A cross-sectional study design was employed, with data collection from a sample of females aged 18 to 45 residing in Jordan during 5-6 July 2023, using a convenient approach via an online distributed questionnaire. The final study sample comprised 315 respondents, with 67.6% who have heard of RSV before the study. If the vaccine was safe, effective, and provided freely, 70.2% showed willingness to get the RSV vaccine, 15.2% resisted, and 14.6% were hesitant. Principal component analysis identified six internally consistent sub-scales with the following suggested themes: Advice, Burden, Conspiracy, Dangers, Efficiency, and Fear, comprising 21 items collectively as assigned as the \"ABCDEF\" scale for RSV vaccine acceptance. RSV vaccine acceptance in this study was associated with the advice and fear constructs. The validated survey instrument successfully captured important determinants of RSV vaccine acceptance among young females. RSV vaccine promotion efforts should focus on the following: enhancing vaccine education, improving trust in healthcare institutions and providers, reducing burdens through resolving cost issues and focusing on the role of social support, addressing safety concerns, and tailoring communication strategies to effectively promote the benefits of the vaccine. These insights can inform public health policies and interventions aiming to promote RSV vaccination and mitigate the burden of RSV-related diseases among infants. Follow-up studies are recommended with pregnant women as the target group to assess their attitude towards RSV vaccination and to confirm the validity of the conceived ABCDEF survey instrument."

Water buffaloes were vaccinated with the vaccine RB51. A booster vaccination was administered at 12 months of age. When turning 23-25 months old, female animals were induced to pregnancy. RB51-specific antibodies were detected and quantified using a CFT based on the RB51 antigen. Vaccinated animals showed a positive serological reaction following each vaccine injection, but titers and the duration of the antibody differed among animals. For 36 weeks after booster vaccination, the comparison of CFT values between vaccinated and control groups remained constantly significant. Afterwards, antibody titers decreased. No relevant changes in antibody response were recorded during pregnancy or lactation. In conclusion, results indicated that the vaccination schedule applied is safe and allows for vaccinated and unvaccinated controls to be discriminated between for up to 8 months after booster vaccination."

The prevailing Th2 profile in advanced CTCL underscores the significance of understanding IL-4/IL-13 expression dynamics from the early stages of disease, as a shift from Th1 to Th2 may explain CTCL progression. Targeted agents blocking key cytokines of type 2 immunity are established therapeutics in atopic disorders and have a promising therapeutic potential in CTCL, given their involvement in cutaneous symptoms and their contribution to the pathogenesis of disease. IL-4, IL-13, and IL-31 are implicated in pruritus, offering therapeutic targets with dupilumab, tralokinumab, lebrikizumab, and nemolizumab. This review analyzes current knowledge on the IL-4/IL-13 axis in mycosis fungoides and Sezary syndrome, the most common types of CTCL, examining existing literature on the pathogenetic implications with a focus on investigational treatments. Clinical trials and case reports are required to shed light on novel uses of medications in various diseases, and ongoing research into the role of IL-4/IL-13 axis blockers in CTCL therapy might not only improve the management of disease-related pruritus but also provide in-depth insights on the pathophysiologic mechanisms of CTCL."

Fewer than 20% of patients only survive beyond five years from diagnosis. CRC is a highly preventable disease if diagnosed at the early stage of malignancy. Several screening methods like endoscopy (like colonoscopy; gold standard), imaging examination [computed tomographic colonography (CTC)], guaiac-based fecal occult blood (gFOBT), immunochemical test from faeces, and stool DNA test are available with different levels of sensitivity and specificity. The available screening methods are associated with certain drawbacks like invasiveness, cost, or sensitivity. In recent years, computer-aided systems-based screening, diagnosis, and treatment have been very promising in the early-stage detection and diagnosis of CRC cases. Artificial intelligence (AI) is an enormously in-demand, cost-effective technology, that uses various tools machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) to screen, diagnose, and stage, and has great potential to treat CRC. Moreover, different ML algorithms and neural networks [artificial neural network (ANN), k-nearest neighbors (KNN), and support vector machines (SVMs)] have been deployed to predict precise and personalized treatment options. This review examines and summarizes different ML and DL models used for therapeutic intervention in CRC cancer along with the gap and challenges for AI."

This paper discusses CCE2 in further detail. It explains newly developed colon capsule system and the current status on the use of CCE, it also provides a comprehensive summary of systematic reviews on the implementation of CCE in colorectal cancer screening from a methodological perspective. Patients with ulcerative colitis can benefit from CCE2 in terms of assessing mucosal inflammation. As part of this review, performance of CCE2 for assessing disease severity in ulcerative colitis is compared with colonoscopy.

CT colonography uses minimally invasive evaluation of colorectum and has better patient acceptance, which appears to be a promising screening modality to improve low colorectal cancer screening rate. This study investigated the utilization patterns of CT colonography and factors associated with its use among U.S. adult population. This retrospective cross-sectional study analyzed the National Health Interview Survey 2015 and 2018. U.S. adults ages 45 or older without a history of colorectal cancer were included. Survey design-adjusted Wald F tests were used to compare the utilization of CT colonography during the study period. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify the predictors of CT colonography among individual socioeconomic and health-related characteristics. The study sample included 34,768 individuals representing 129,430,319 U.S. adult population ages 45 or older. The overall utilization of CT colonography increased from 0.79% in 2015 to 1.33% in 2018 (<i>P</i> < 0.001). 54.5% study participants reported being up-to-date on recommended colorectal cancer screening; of those, 1.8% used CT colonography. Compared with individuals ages 65+, those ages 45-49 years were 2.08 times (OR, 2.08, 95% confidence interval, 1.01-4.35) more likely to use CT colonography. Socioeconomically disadvantaged characteristics (e.g., racial/ethnic minority, low income, publicly funded insurance) were associated with a greater likelihood of CT colonography. This study demonstrated an increasing trend in utilization of CT colonography for colorectal cancer screening in U.S. adults. Younger individuals, racial/ethnic minorities, or those with lower income appear to have a higher CT colonography utilization. PREVENTION RELEVANCE: Although computed tomographic (CT) colonography has been proved to be cost-effective and have better patient acceptance, its overall utilization for colorectal cancer (CRC) screening is low (<1.4%) among US adults aged 45+ in 2018. More efforts are needed to implement strategies to increase CT colonography for effective CRC prevention."

Materials and Methods Observed participation rates and screening costs from the Colonoscopy or Colonography for Screening, or COCOS, trial were used in a microsimulation model to estimate costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained with colonoscopy and CT colonography screening. For both tests, the authors determined optimal age range and screening interval combinations assuming a 100% participation rate. Assuming observed participation for these combinations, the cost-effectiveness of both tests was compared. Extracolonic findings were not included because long-term follow-up data are lacking. Results The participation rates for colonoscopy and CT colonography were 21.5% (1276 of 5924 invitees) and 33.6% (982 of 2920 invitees), respectively. Colonoscopy was more cost-effective in the screening strategies with one or two lifetime screenings, whereas CT colonography was more cost-effective in strategies with more lifetime screenings. CT colonography was the preferred test for willingness-to-pay-thresholds of \u20ac3200 per QALY gained and higher, which is lower than the Dutch willingness-to-pay threshold of \u20ac20 000. With equal participation, colonoscopy was the preferred test independent of willingness-to-pay thresholds. The findings were robust for most of the sensitivity analyses, except with regard to relative screening costs and subsequent participation. Conclusion Because of the higher participation rates, CT colonography screening for colorectal cancer is more cost-effective than colonoscopy screening. The implementation of CT colonography screening requires previous satisfactory resolution to the question as to how best to deal with extracolonic findings. <sup>\u00a9</sup> RSNA, 2018 Online supplemental material is available for this article."

The effectiveness of screening estimated by discounted life years gained (LYGs) compared to no screening, differed considerably between the studies. Despite these differences, all studies consistently emphasized that screening for CRC was cost-effective compared with no screening for each of the recognized screening strategies. Newer technologies for colorectal cancer screening, including computed tomographic colonography (CTC), faecal DNA test, and Pillcam Colon are less invasive and accurate, however, they are not cost-effective, as their cost was higher than all other established screening strategies.

While the role of CTC as a primary test for population screening of CRC is under investigation, the fecal occult blood test (FOBT) has been recommended for population screening of CRC in Europe. Subjects with positive FOBT are invited to undergo total colonoscopy, which has some critical issues, such as suboptimal compliance, contraindications and the possibility of an incomplete exploration of the colon. Based on available data, the integration of CTC in FOBT-based population screening programs for CRC may fall into three scenarios. First, CTC is recommended in FOBT-positive subjects when colonoscopy is refused, incomplete or contraindicated. For these indications CTC should replace double-contrast barium enema. Second, conversely, CTC is not currently recommended as a second-level examination prior to colonoscopy in all FOBT-positive subjects, as this strategy is most probably not cost-effective. Finally, CTC may be considered instead of colonoscopy for surveillance after adenoma removal, but specific studies are needed."

ZIKV is a virus transmitted by arthropods (arboviruses), mainly by Aedes mosquitoes. ZIKV can also be transmitted to humans through mechanisms other than vector infection such as sexual intercourse, blood transfusions, and mother-to-child transmission. The latter mode of transmission can give rise to a severe clinical form called congenital Zika syndrome (CZS), which can result in spontaneous abortion or serious pathological alterations in the fetus such as microcephaly or neurological and orofacial anomalies. In this study, beside a succinct overview of the etiological, microbiological, and epidemiological aspects and modes of transmission of Zika virus infections, we have focused our attention on the pathogenetic and histopathological aspects in pregnancy and the pathogenetic and molecular mechanisms that can determine microcephaly, and consequently the clinical alterations, typical of the fetus and newborns, in a subject affected by CZS."

The latter became the cause of the 2015-2016 pandemic, with severe consequences for newborns. In West African countries, the African lineage was found, but there is evidence of the emergence of the Asian-American lineage in Cape Verde and Angola. This highlights the need to not only monitor ZIKV but also sequence the isolates. In this article, we present a case report of Zika fever in a pregnant woman from Guinea identified in 2018. Viral RNA was detected through qRT-PCR in a serum sample. In addition, the seroconversion of anti-Zika IgM and IgG antibodies was detected in repeated blood samples. Subsequently, the virus was isolated from the C6/36 cell line. The detected ZIKV belonged to the African lineage, the Nigerian sublineage. The strains with the closest sequences were isolated from mosquitoes in Senegal in 2011 and 2015. In addition, we conducted the serological screening of 116 blood samples collected from patients presenting to the hospital of Faranah with fevers during the period 2018-2021. As a result, it was found that IgM-positive patients were identified each year and that the seroprevalence varied between 5.6% and 17.1%."

However, little is known about the neurodevelopmental consequences of maternal respiratory viral infections, which are the most prevalent infections during pregnancy. The recent COVID-19 pandemic has increased the interest in understanding the consequences of infections in offspring's development. This systematic review explores whether maternal gestational viral respiratory infections are associated with neurodevelopmental deviations in children below 10 years-old. The search was conducted in Pubmed, PsychInfo and Web of Science databases. 13 articles were revised, including information about maternal infection (Influenza, SARS-CoV-2 and unspecified respiratory infections) and offspring's neurodevelopment (global development, specific functions, temperament and behavioral/emotional aspects). Controversial results were reported regarding maternal respiratory infections during pregnancy and infants' neurodevelopment. Maternal infections seem to be associated with subtle alterations in some offspring's developmental subdomains, as early motor development, and attentional, behavioral/emotional minor problems. Further studies are needed to determine the impact of other psychosocial confounding factors."

During this period, viral infections represent a risk to the mother, the placental unit, and the fetus. The Zika virus (ZIKV) outbreak in Brazil has been the cause of congenital Zika syndrome (CZS), with devastating consequences such as microcephaly in newborns. Herein, we analyzed the impact of maternal overweight/obesity on the antiviral factors' expression in the placental tissue of Zika-infected mothers. We accessed placentas from women with and without obesity from 34 public health units (S\u00e3o Paulo) and from Zika-infected mothers with and without obesity from the Clinical Cohort Study of ZIKV pregnant women (Rio de Janeiro, Brazil). We first verified that obesity, without infection, did not alter the constitutive transcriptional expression of antiviral factors or IFN type I/III expression. Interestingly, obesity, when associated with ZIKV infection, showed a decreased transcriptional expression of RIG-I and IFIH1 (MDA-5 protein precursor gene). At the protein level, we also verified a decreased RIG-I and IRF-3 expression in the decidual placenta from the Zika-infected obese group, regardless of microcephaly. This finding shows, for the first time, that obesity associated with ZIKV infection leads to an impaired type I IFN downstream signaling pathway in the maternal-fetal interface."

In this review, we characterize decidual and placental immunity during maternal viral (co)-infection with HIV-1, human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), and Zika virus. We discuss placental immunology, clinical presentation, and epidemiology, before characterizing host susceptibility and cellular tropism, and how the three viruses gain access into specific placental target cells. We describe current knowledge on host-viral interactions with decidual and stromal human placental macrophages or Hofbauer cells, trophoblasts including extra villous trophoblasts, T cells, and decidual natural killer (dNK) cells. These clinically significant viral infections elicit both innate and adaptive immune responses to control replication. However, the three viruses either during mono- or co-infection (HIV-1 and HCMV) escape detection to initiate placental inflammation associated with viral transmission to the developing fetus. Aside from congenital or perinatal infection, other adverse pregnancy outcomes include preterm labor and spontaneous abortion. In addition, maternal HIV-1 and HCMV co-infection are associated with impaired fetal and infant immunity in postnatal life and poor clinical outcomes during childhood in exposed infants, even in the absence of vertical transmission of HIV-1. Given the rapidly expanding numbers of HIV-1-exposed uninfected infants and children globally, further research is urgently needed on neonatal immune programming during maternal mono-and co-infection. This review therefore includes sections on current knowledge gaps that may prompt future research directions. These gaps reflect an emerging but poorly characterized field. Their significance and potential investigation is underscored by the fact that although viral infections result in adverse consequences in both mother and developing fetus/newborn, antiviral and immunomodulatory therapies can improve clinical outcomes in the dyad."

In many cases these outbreaks have had considerable perinatal health consequences including increased risk of preterm delivery (e.g., influenza, measles, and COVID-19), and the delivery of low birth weight or small for gestational age babies (e.g., influenza, COVID-19). Furthermore, severe perinatal outcomes including perinatal and infant death are a known consequence of multiple infectious diseases (e.g., Ebola virus disease, Zika virus disease, pertussis, and measles). In addition to vaccination during pregnancy (where possible), pregnant women, are provided some level of protection from the adverse effects of infection through community-level application of evidence-based transmission-control methods. This review demonstrates that it takes almost 2 years for the perinatal impacts of an infectious disease outbreak to be reported. However, many infectious disease outbreaks between 2010 and 2020 have no associated pregnancy data reported in the scientific literature, or pregnancy data is reported in the form of case-studies only. This lack of systematic data collection and reporting has a negative impact on our understanding of these diseases and the implications they may have for pregnant women and their unborn infants. Monitoring perinatal health is an essential aspect of national and global healthcare strategies as perinatal life has a critical impact on early life mortality as well as possible effects on later life health. The unpredictable nature of emerging infections and the potential for adverse perinatal outcomes necessitate that we thoroughly assess pregnancy and perinatal health implications of disease outbreaks and their public health interventions in tandem with outbreak response efforts. Disease surveillance programs should incorporate perinatal health monitoring and health systems around the world should endeavor to continuously collect perinatal health data in order to quickly update pregnancy care protocols as needed."

Infections in pregnant women are of major concern because of potential devastating consequences during pregnancy and have been associated with microcephaly in newborns. ZIKV has a unique ability to use the host machinery to promote viral replication in a tissue-specific manner, resulting in characteristic pathological disorders. Recent studies have proposed that the host ubiquitin system acts as a major determinant of ZIKV tropism by providing the virus with an enhanced ability to enter new cells. In addition, ZIKV has developed mechanisms to evade the host immune response, thereby allowing the establishment of viral persistence and enhancing viral pathogenesis. We discuss recent reports on the mechanisms used by ZIKV to replicate efficiently, and we highlight potential new areas of research for the development of therapeutic approaches."

This resulted in forty-five human cases, including seven deaths, and the identification of JEV infection in over 80 commercial piggeries. <b><i>Materials and Methods:</i></b> We collected mosquitoes which were trapped using CO<sub>2</sub>-baited light traps deployed near piggeries reporting disease or in regions linked to human cases in the Wide Bay region in the state of Queensland. Mosquitoes from four traps yielded JEV RNA by real-time RT-PCR. Pools containing RNA positive mosquitoes were inoculated onto mosquito cell monolayers. <b><i>Discussion:</i></b> A single isolate of JEV was obtained from a pool of mixed mosquito species. Near whole genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of the JEV isolate demonstrated its high genomic relatedness with JEV GIV pig sequences sampled from Queensland and the state of New South Wales in 2022. <b><i>Conclusion:</i></b> We report the first isolation of JEV GIV from mosquitoes collected in Australia. With only a few JEV GIV isolates available globally, the isolate we report will be essential for future research of JEV host interactions, evolution and disease markers, and development of effective therapies, vaccines, diagnostic assays, and mosquito control strategies."

Fortunately, the development of vaccines has enabled effective defense against JE. However, re-emerging genotype V (GV) JEV poses a challenge as current vaccines are genotype III (GIII)-based and provide suboptimal protection. Given the isolation of GV JEVs from Malaysia, China, and the Republic of Korea, there is a concern about the potential for a broader outbreak. Under the hypothesis that a GV-based vaccine is necessary for effective defense against GV JEV, we developed a pentameric recombinant antigen using cholera toxin B as a scaffold and mucosal adjuvant, which was conjugated with the E protein domain III of GV by genetic fusion. This GV-based vaccine antigen induced a more effective immune response in mice against GV JEV isolates compared to GIII-based antigen and efficiently protected animals from lethal challenges. Furthermore, a bivalent vaccine approach, inoculating simultaneously with GIII- and GV-based antigens, showed protective efficacy against both GIII and GV JEVs. This strategy presents a promising avenue for comprehensive protection in regions facing the threat of diverse JEV genotypes, including both prevalent GIII and GI as well as emerging GV strains."

However, the burden of chikungunya virus (CHIKV) among pediatric AES (pAES) is unknown from E-UP. We included 238 hospitalized pAES cases. The presence of IgM antibodies for CHIKV, and Dengue virus (DENV) was tested, and RT-PCR was performed for CHIKV and DENV in serologically confirmed CHIKV and DENV pAES cases. Positive samples were sequenced using Sangers sequencing. Further, to check for co-infection, IgM antibodies for other AES etiologies including Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), Leptospira and Orientia tsutsugamushi (OT) in serum were also investigated. IgM ELISA demonstrated 5.04% (12) positivity for CHIKV. Among CHIKV IgM positive, 3 (25%, 3/12) pAES patients died. CHIKV genome was detected in 3 pAES specimens. Among which, 2 CHIKV cases were also positive for OT DNA. Partially sequenced CHIKV were genotyped as ECSA.

Consequently, increasing VLPs production is important and can be achieved by optimizing expression plasmids and cell culture conditions. While attempting to express genotype III (GIII) Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) VLPs containing the G104H mutation in the envelope (E) protein, we failed to generate VLPs in COS-1 cells. However, VLPs production was restored by cultivating plasmid-transfected cells at a lower temperature, specifically 28\u00a0\u00b0C. Furthermore, we observed that the enhancement in JEV VLPs production was independent of amino acid mutations in the E protein. The optimal condition for JEV VLPs production in plasmid-transfected COS-1 cells consisted of an initial culture at 37\u00a0\u00b0C for 6\u00a0h, followed by a shift to 28\u00a0\u00b0C (37/28\u00a0\u00b0C) for cultivation. Under 37/28\u00a0\u00b0C cultivation conditions, flavivirus VLPs production significantly increased in various mammalian cell lines regardless of whether its expression was transiently transfected or clonally selected cells. Remarkably, clonally selected cell lines expressing flavivirus VLPs consistently achieved yields exceeding 1\u00a0\u03bcg/ml. Binding affinity analyses using monoclonal antibodies revealed similar binding patterns for VLPs of genotype I (GI) JEV, GIII JEV, West Nile virus (WNV), and dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV-2) produced under both 37\u00a0\u00b0C or 37/28\u00a0\u00b0C cultivation conditions. In summary, our study demonstrated that the production of flavivirus VLPs can be significantly improved under 37/28\u00a0\u00b0C cultivation conditions without affecting the conformational structure of the E protein. KEYPOINTS: \u2022 Low-temperature culture (37/28\u00a0\u00b0C) enhances production of flavivirus VLPs. \u2022 Flavivirus VLPs consistently achieved yields exceeding 1\u00a0\u03bcg/ml. \u2022 37/28\u00a0\u00b0C cultivation did not alter the structure of flavivirus VLPs."

The neurovirulence of the mutant virus was significantly reduced in mice. Analysis of the immunogenicity of the chimeric virus revealed that it induced neutralizing antibodies against JEV GI in mice, and the protective efficacy of SA14-GI env was higher than that of SA14-14-2.

The N-terminal protease domain (180 residues) of NS3 (NS3(pro)) interacts directly with a central 40-amino acid hydrophilic domain of NS2B (NS2B(H)) to form an active serine protease. In this study, the recombinant NS2B(H)-NS3(pro) proteases were prepared in <i>E. coli</i> and used to compare the enzymatic activity between genotype I (GI) and III (GIII) NS2B-NS3 proteases. The GI NS2B(H)-NS3(pro) was able to cleave the sites at internal C, NS2A/NS2B, NS2B/NS3 and NS3/NS4A junctions that were identical to the sites proteolytically processed by GIII NS2B(H)-NS3(pro). Analysis of the enzymatic activity of recombinant NS2B(H)-NS3(pro) proteases using a model of fluorogenic peptide substrate revealed that the proteolytical processing activity of GIII NS2B(H)-NS3(pro) was significantly higher than that of GI NS2B(H)-NS3(pro). There were eight amino acid variations between GI and GIII NS2B(H)-NS3(pro), which may be responsible for the difference in enzymatic activities between GI and GIII proteases. Therefore, recombinant mutants were generated by exchanging NS2B(H) and NS3(pro) domains between GI and GIII NS2B(H)-NS3(pro) and subjected to protease activity analysis. Substitution of NS2B(H) significantly altered the protease activities, as compared to the parental NS2B(H)-NS3(pro), suggesting that NS2B(H) played an essential role in regulation of NS3(pro) protease activity. To further identify the amino acids responsible for the difference in protease activities, multiple substitution mutants including the individual and combined mutations at the variant residue 55 and 65 of NS2B(H) were generated and subjected to protease activity analysis. Replacement of NS2B-55 and NS2B-65 of GI to GIII significantly increased the enzymatic activity of GI NS2B(H)-NS3(pro) protease, whereas mutation of NS2B-55 and NS2B-65 of GIII to GI remarkably reduced the enzymatic activity of GIII NS2B(H)-NS3(pro) protease. Overall, these data demonstrated that NS2B-55 and NS2B-65 variations in hydrophilic domain of NS2B co-contributed to the difference in NS2B(H)-NS3(pro) protease activities between GI and GIII. These observations gain an insight into the role of NS2B in regulation of NS3 protease activities, which is useful for understanding the replication of JEV GI and GIII viruses."

These genotypes are the primary agents of viral encephalitis in the Asian continent. Genotypes 4 and 5 have remained silent in low-latitude tropical regions since their discovery. From 2009, the hidden genotype 5 suddenly emerged simultaneously in mosquitoes from the Tibetan region of China and those from South Korea in East Asia. The detection of genotype 5 of JEV in these mosquitoes was associated with cases of viral encephalitis in the local population. Similarly, in 2022, the long-silent genotype 4 of JEV emerged in Australia, resulting in a local outbreak of viral encephalitis that primarily affected adults and caused fatalities. The emergence and outbreaks of genotypes 4 and 5 of JEV present new challenges for the prevention and control of Japanese encephalitis (JE). This study not only analyzes the recent emergence of these new genotypes but also discusses their implications in the development of JE vaccines and laboratory tests for newly emerging JEV infections."

Proteinuria is a frequently encountered adverse effect, regardless of prior administration of vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitors. Herein, we aimed to assess the impact of baseline preexisting proteinuria on regorafenib-induced problematic proteinuria during real-world mCRC therapy. Patients with mCRC receiving regorafenib (n\u2009=\u2009100) were retrospectively assessed and divided into control and preexisting proteinuria (baseline grade of 1-2) groups. The primary endpoint was the development of grade\u2009\u2265\u20092 (grade\u2009\u2265\u20093 in case of baseline grade 2 patients) proteinuria. Propensity score-matching was performed to confirm the robustness of primary analyses. Defined proteinuria occurred in 30.7 and 57.9% of patients in the control and preexisting proteinuria groups, respectively, with significant differences in the all-patient population (P\u2009=\u20090.01). The preexisting proteinuria group exhibited significant defined proteinuria development within 7\u00a0days of regorafenib initiation, grade\u2009\u2265\u20093 symptoms, and treatment suspension owing to proteinuria. Similar results were obtained in the propensity score-matched population. According to multivariate logistic regression analysis, baseline proteinuria was a singular risk factor for defined proteinuria development (adjusted odds ratio; 3.76, 95% confidence interval; 1.45-9.75, P\u2009=\u20090.007). Collectively, our study revealed that patients with preexisting proteinuria develop regorafenib-induced proteinuria degradation."

Due to frequent and increasing use, leading to eventual excretion with body fluids, their residues have been found in hospital and household wastewaters as well as surface water. However, the effects of TKI residues in the environment on aquatic organisms are poorly described. In the present study, we investigated the cytotoxic and genotoxic effects of five selected TKIs, namely erlotinib (ERL), dasatinib (DAS), nilotinib (NIL), regorafenib (REG), and sorafenib (SOR), using the in vitro zebrafish liver cell (ZFL) model. Cytotoxicity was determined using the MTS assay and propidium iodide (PI) live/dead staining by flow cytometry. DAS, SOR, and REG decreased ZFL cell viability dose- and time-dependently, with DAS being the most cytotoxic TKI studied. ERL and NIL did not affect viability at concentrations up to their maximum solubility; however, NIL was the only TKI that significantly decreased the proportion of PI negative cells as determined by the flow cytometry. Cell cycle progression analyses showed that DAS, ERL, REG, and SOR caused the cell cycle arrest of ZFL cells in the G0/G1 phase, with a concomitant decrease of cells in the S-phase fraction. No data could be obtained for NIL due to severe DNA fragmentation. The genotoxic activity of the investigated TKIs was evaluated using comet and cytokinesis block micronucleus (CBMN) assays. The dose-dependent induction of DNA single strand breaks was induced by NIL (\u22652 \u03bcM), DAS (\u22650.006 \u03bcM), and REG (\u22650.8 \u03bcM), with DAS being the most potent. None of the TKIs studied induced micronuclei formation. These results suggest that normal non-target fish liver cells are sensitive to the TKIs studied in a concentration range similar to those previously reported for human cancer cell lines. Although the TKI concentrations that induced adverse effects in exposed ZFL cells are several orders of magnitude higher than those currently expected in the aquatic environment, the observed DNA damage and cell cycle effects suggest that residues of TKIs in the environment may pose a hazard to non-intentionally exposed organisms living in environments contaminated with TKIs."

Patients with severe asthma represent a substantial share of consumption of healthcare resources and hospitalization. Moreover, these patients are at risk of increased morbidity and mortality. Recently, several phenotypes and endotypes of asthma have been identified. The identification of specific subtypes of asthma is fundamental for optimizing the clinical benefit of novel treatments. Although in most patients the disease can be controlled by some combination of pharmacologic agents, in some 5-10% of patients the disease remains uncontrolled. Several monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting pathogenetic molecules (e.g., IgE, IL-5, IL- 5R\u03b1, IL-4, IL-13, TSLP) are currently available or under development for the treatment of different forms of severe type 2 asthma. The identification of diagnostic and predictive biomarkers (e.g., IgE, blood eosinophil count, FeNO, periostin, etc.) has revolutioned the field of targeted therapy in severe asthma. Monoclonal antibodies targeting Th2-driven inflammation are generally safe in adult patients with moderate-to-severe asthma. The long-term safety of these biologics is a relevant issue that should be addressed. Unfortunately, little is known about non-type 2 asthma. Further studies are needed to identify biomarkers to guide targeted therapies of different forms of non-type 2 asthma."

Some herpesviruses persist within dividing cells, putting the viral genome at risk of being lost to the cytoplasm during mitosis because karyokinesis (nuclear division) requires nuclear envelope breakdown. Oncogenic herpesviruses (and papillomaviruses) avoid genome loss during mitosis by tethering their genomes to cellular chromosomes, thereby ensuring viral genome uptake into newly formed nuclei. These viruses use viral proteins with DNA- and chromatin-binding capabilities to physically link viral and cellular genomes together in a process called tethering. The known viral tethering proteins of human papillomavirus (E2), Epstein-Barr virus (EBNA1), and Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (LANA) each contain two independent domains required for genome tethering, one that binds sequence specifically to the viral genome and another that binds to cellular chromatin. This latter domain is called a chromatin tethering domain (CTD). The human cytomegalovirus UL123 gene encodes a CTD that is required for the virus to productively infect dividing fibroblast cells within the S phase of the cell cycle, presumably by tethering the viral genome to cellular chromosomes during mitosis. The CTD-containing UL123 gene product that supports S-phase infections is the IE19 protein. Here, we define two motifs in IE19 required for S-phase infections: an N-terminal triple lysine motif and a C-terminal nucleosome-binding motif within the CTD.IMPORTANCEThe IE19 protein encoded by human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is required for S-phase infection of dividing cells, likely because it tethers the viral genome to cellular chromosomes, thereby allowing them to survive mitosis. The mechanism through which IE19 tethers viral genomes to cellular chromosomes is not understood. For human papillomavirus, Epstein-Barr virus, and Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus, viral genome tethering is required for persistence (latency) and pathogenesis (oncogenesis). Like these viruses, HCMV also achieves latency, and it modulates the properties of glioblastoma multiforme tumors. Therefore, defining the mechanism through which IE19 tethers viral genomes to cellular chromosomes may help us understand, and ultimately combat or control, HCMV latency and oncomodulation."

Therefore, this study was done to determine the prevalence of HR-HPV in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) and its correlation with p16 and chewing habits. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) biopsy specimens of 186 samples were tested for HR-HPV type 16/18 by PCR, followed by p16 immunostaining (IHC) in a subset of cases (n = 50). Appropriate statistical tests were applied to find the association between HR-HPV/p16 and peculiar chewing habits with significance criteria of p<0.05 with 95% CI. HR-HPV (type 16 &18) was present in seven out of 186 cases (3.8%). Of these seven cases, five were positive for HPV16, whereas two were positive for HPV16/18. The overall expression of p16 protein in 50 samples was 38% (n = 19), and among these 19-IHC positive samples, 26% were positive for HR-HPV DNA. No significant association was found between HR-HPV positivity and p16 and chewing habits (p>0.05). It was concluded that HR-HPV prevalence in OSCC was very low in our population, with no statistically significant correlation with p16 and chewing habits.

High-resolution anoscopy (HRA) is an in-clinic procedure to detect precancerous anal lesions and cancer, yet prospective data on factors associated with HRA attendance are lacking. We examined whether anal HPV sampling at home versus in a clinic impacts HRA uptake and assessed HRA acceptability. Methods Sexual and gender minority individuals were randomised to home-based self-sampling or clinical sampling. All were asked to attend in-clinic HRA 1year later. We regressed HRA attendance on study arm using multivariable Poisson regression and assessed HRA acceptability using \u03c7 2 tests. Results A total of 62.8% of 196 participants who engaged in screening attended HRA. Although not significant (P =0.13), a higher proportion of participants who engaged in clinic-based screening attended HRA (68.5%) compared to home-based participants (57.9%). Overall, HRA uptake was higher among participants with anal cytology history (aRR 1.40, 95% CI 1.07-1.82), and lower among participants preferring a versatile anal sex position versus insertive (aRR 0.70, 95% CI 0.53-0.91), but did not differ by race or HIV serostatus. In the clinic arm, persons living with HIV had lower HRA attendance (42.9%) versus HIV-negative participants (73.3%) (P =0.02) and Black non-Hispanic participants had lower HRA attendance (41.7%) than White non-Hispanic participants (73.1%), (P =0.04). No differences in attendance by race or HIV status were observed in the home arm. Conclusions HRA uptake differed significantly by race and HIV status in the clinic arm but not the home arm."

In recent years, with a better understanding of the effectiveness and safety of vaccinations, many recommendations have been developed for administering vaccines to adults. Countless physiological changes occur during pregnancy, including those affecting the immune system. Pregnant women are at increased risk of developing infections and resulting complications. According to research, vaccines are immunogenic and safe for pregnant women. Pregnancy is not an absolute contraindication to vaccination. After administration of vaccines to pregnant women, the concentration of antibodies increases, which can be transferred to the child in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy and provide protection in the first months of life. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), guidelines of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology (ACOG) unanimously recommend vaccination of pregnant women if a safe vaccine is available and there is a risk of exposure of the woman to a disease that threatens herself or her developing baby. In everyday clinical practice, medical professionals should provide their patients with the necessary information on vaccinations, which may contribute to greater awareness and implementation of vaccinations. This article aims to review current global recommendations for the vaccination of pregnant and breastfeeding women, including against the Omicron variants of SARS-CoV-2."

The key characteristic of this disease is the birth of persistently infected (PI) lambs which, after surviving transplacental infection, are born antibody negative, yet virus positive, and thus shed the virus for their entire life and are the primary source of spread within a flock. The cornerstones of BDV control are detection and elimination of PI animals, biosecurity measures to prevent re-infection, and surveillance programs. Recommendations for the control of BDV in sheep are centred around the approach to bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV), the prominent cattle pestivirus species, due to a lack of specific research into BDV control and elimination. In this study, two aspects of a BDV control program were investigated: the effectiveness of the BVDV vaccine, Pestigard\u00ae, and the rate of seroconversion in a flock deliberately exposed to known PI lambs. The vaccine appeared to be safe, and the optimal dose was the full cattle dose (2\u2009mL). While vaccination induced high virus neutralising titres to BVDV when administered as either a quarter, half or full dose registered for cattle, the BDV titres achieved were low and unlikely to prevent transplacental infection. In a second study, after exposure of between 2 and 15\u2009days exposure to two PI lambs in confined conditions, only 3 of 66 previously na\u00efve sheep demonstrated seroconversion. This demonstrated a very low rate of transmission and suggested that deliberate exposure to PI lambs at low-risk times for less than 15\u2009days was not likely to be an effective means of achieving seroconversion throughout a flock and, therefore, not provide protection against BDV challenge during gestation."

Vaccination can reduce the burden of RSV-related respiratory disease, with previous studies showing its substantial medical and financial burden in Jordan. However, pregnant women may exhibit hesitancy to get vaccinated due to concerns about potential risks to themselves or their fetuses. This study aimed to assess the acceptance of the RSV vaccine among young females and identify the determinants influencing their decision using a newly constructed instrument. A survey instrument was developed and validated, comprising 26 items to measure RSV vaccine acceptance. A cross-sectional study design was employed, with data collection from a sample of females aged 18 to 45 residing in Jordan during 5-6 July 2023, using a convenient approach via an online distributed questionnaire. The final study sample comprised 315 respondents, with 67.6% who have heard of RSV before the study. If the vaccine was safe, effective, and provided freely, 70.2% showed willingness to get the RSV vaccine, 15.2% resisted, and 14.6% were hesitant. Principal component analysis identified six internally consistent sub-scales with the following suggested themes: Advice, Burden, Conspiracy, Dangers, Efficiency, and Fear, comprising 21 items collectively as assigned as the \"ABCDEF\" scale for RSV vaccine acceptance. RSV vaccine acceptance in this study was associated with the advice and fear constructs. The validated survey instrument successfully captured important determinants of RSV vaccine acceptance among young females. RSV vaccine promotion efforts should focus on the following: enhancing vaccine education, improving trust in healthcare institutions and providers, reducing burdens through resolving cost issues and focusing on the role of social support, addressing safety concerns, and tailoring communication strategies to effectively promote the benefits of the vaccine. These insights can inform public health policies and interventions aiming to promote RSV vaccination and mitigate the burden of RSV-related diseases among infants. Follow-up studies are recommended with pregnant women as the target group to assess their attitude towards RSV vaccination and to confirm the validity of the conceived ABCDEF survey instrument."

The aim of the study was to evaluate the safety and kinetics of antibody responses in water buffaloes vaccinated according to the protocol described for the bovine species in the WOAH Manual, modified with the use of a triple dose. Water buffaloes were vaccinated with the vaccine RB51. A booster vaccination was administered at 12 months of age. When turning 23-25 months old, female animals were induced to pregnancy. RB51-specific antibodies were detected and quantified using a CFT based on the RB51 antigen. Vaccinated animals showed a positive serological reaction following each vaccine injection, but titers and the duration of the antibody differed among animals. For 36 weeks after booster vaccination, the comparison of CFT values between vaccinated and control groups remained constantly significant. Afterwards, antibody titers decreased. No relevant changes in antibody response were recorded during pregnancy or lactation. In conclusion, results indicated that the vaccination schedule applied is safe and allows for vaccinated and unvaccinated controls to be discriminated between for up to 8 months after booster vaccination."

The prevailing Th2 profile in advanced CTCL underscores the significance of understanding IL-4/IL-13 expression dynamics from the early stages of disease, as a shift from Th1 to Th2 may explain CTCL progression. Targeted agents blocking key cytokines of type 2 immunity are established therapeutics in atopic disorders and have a promising therapeutic potential in CTCL, given their involvement in cutaneous symptoms and their contribution to the pathogenesis of disease. IL-4, IL-13, and IL-31 are implicated in pruritus, offering therapeutic targets with dupilumab, tralokinumab, lebrikizumab, and nemolizumab. This review analyzes current knowledge on the IL-4/IL-13 axis in mycosis fungoides and Sezary syndrome, the most common types of CTCL, examining existing literature on the pathogenetic implications with a focus on investigational treatments. Clinical trials and case reports are required to shed light on novel uses of medications in various diseases, and ongoing research into the role of IL-4/IL-13 axis blockers in CTCL therapy might not only improve the management of disease-related pruritus but also provide in-depth insights on the pathophysiologic mechanisms of CTCL."

Fewer than 20% of patients only survive beyond five years from diagnosis. CRC is a highly preventable disease if diagnosed at the early stage of malignancy. Several screening methods like endoscopy (like colonoscopy; gold standard), imaging examination [computed tomographic colonography (CTC)], guaiac-based fecal occult blood (gFOBT), immunochemical test from faeces, and stool DNA test are available with different levels of sensitivity and specificity. The available screening methods are associated with certain drawbacks like invasiveness, cost, or sensitivity. In recent years, computer-aided systems-based screening, diagnosis, and treatment have been very promising in the early-stage detection and diagnosis of CRC cases. Artificial intelligence (AI) is an enormously in-demand, cost-effective technology, that uses various tools machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) to screen, diagnose, and stage, and has great potential to treat CRC. Moreover, different ML algorithms and neural networks [artificial neural network (ANN), k-nearest neighbors (KNN), and support vector machines (SVMs)] have been deployed to predict precise and personalized treatment options. This review examines and summarizes different ML and DL models used for therapeutic intervention in CRC cancer along with the gap and challenges for AI."

CT colonography uses minimally invasive evaluation of colorectum and has better patient acceptance, which appears to be a promising screening modality to improve low colorectal cancer screening rate. This study investigated the utilization patterns of CT colonography and factors associated with its use among U.S. adult population. This retrospective cross-sectional study analyzed the National Health Interview Survey 2015 and 2018. U.S. adults ages 45 or older without a history of colorectal cancer were included. Survey design-adjusted Wald F tests were used to compare the utilization of CT colonography during the study period. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify the predictors of CT colonography among individual socioeconomic and health-related characteristics. The study sample included 34,768 individuals representing 129,430,319 U.S. adult population ages 45 or older. The overall utilization of CT colonography increased from 0.79% in 2015 to 1.33% in 2018 (<i>P</i> < 0.001). 54.5% study participants reported being up-to-date on recommended colorectal cancer screening; of those, 1.8% used CT colonography. Compared with individuals ages 65+, those ages 45-49 years were 2.08 times (OR, 2.08, 95% confidence interval, 1.01-4.35) more likely to use CT colonography. Socioeconomically disadvantaged characteristics (e.g., racial/ethnic minority, low income, publicly funded insurance) were associated with a greater likelihood of CT colonography. This study demonstrated an increasing trend in utilization of CT colonography for colorectal cancer screening in U.S. adults. Younger individuals, racial/ethnic minorities, or those with lower income appear to have a higher CT colonography utilization. PREVENTION RELEVANCE: Although computed tomographic (CT) colonography has been proved to be cost-effective and have better patient acceptance, its overall utilization for colorectal cancer (CRC) screening is low (<1.4%) among US adults aged 45+ in 2018. More efforts are needed to implement strategies to increase CT colonography for effective CRC prevention."

Materials and Methods Observed participation rates and screening costs from the Colonoscopy or Colonography for Screening, or COCOS, trial were used in a microsimulation model to estimate costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained with colonoscopy and CT colonography screening. For both tests, the authors determined optimal age range and screening interval combinations assuming a 100% participation rate. Assuming observed participation for these combinations, the cost-effectiveness of both tests was compared. Extracolonic findings were not included because long-term follow-up data are lacking. Results The participation rates for colonoscopy and CT colonography were 21.5% (1276 of 5924 invitees) and 33.6% (982 of 2920 invitees), respectively. Colonoscopy was more cost-effective in the screening strategies with one or two lifetime screenings, whereas CT colonography was more cost-effective in strategies with more lifetime screenings. CT colonography was the preferred test for willingness-to-pay-thresholds of \u20ac3200 per QALY gained and higher, which is lower than the Dutch willingness-to-pay threshold of \u20ac20 000. With equal participation, colonoscopy was the preferred test independent of willingness-to-pay thresholds. The findings were robust for most of the sensitivity analyses, except with regard to relative screening costs and subsequent participation. Conclusion Because of the higher participation rates, CT colonography screening for colorectal cancer is more cost-effective than colonoscopy screening. The implementation of CT colonography screening requires previous satisfactory resolution to the question as to how best to deal with extracolonic findings. <sup>\u00a9</sup> RSNA, 2018 Online supplemental material is available for this article."

We reviewed the most relevant articles which discuss the cost-effectiveness of colorectal cancer screening procedures, in particular, the recent ones through the last eight years. The effectiveness of screening estimated by discounted life years gained (LYGs) compared to no screening, differed considerably between the studies. Despite these differences, all studies consistently emphasized that screening for CRC was cost-effective compared with no screening for each of the recognized screening strategies. Newer technologies for colorectal cancer screening, including computed tomographic colonography (CTC), faecal DNA test, and Pillcam Colon are less invasive and accurate, however, they are not cost-effective, as their cost was higher than all other established screening strategies. When compliance and adherence to such new techniques are increased more than the established strategies they would be more cost-effective particularly CTC."

While the role of CTC as a primary test for population screening of CRC is under investigation, the fecal occult blood test (FOBT) has been recommended for population screening of CRC in Europe. Subjects with positive FOBT are invited to undergo total colonoscopy, which has some critical issues, such as suboptimal compliance, contraindications and the possibility of an incomplete exploration of the colon. Based on available data, the integration of CTC in FOBT-based population screening programs for CRC may fall into three scenarios. First, CTC is recommended in FOBT-positive subjects when colonoscopy is refused, incomplete or contraindicated. For these indications CTC should replace double-contrast barium enema. Second, conversely, CTC is not currently recommended as a second-level examination prior to colonoscopy in all FOBT-positive subjects, as this strategy is most probably not cost-effective. Finally, CTC may be considered instead of colonoscopy for surveillance after adenoma removal, but specific studies are needed."

Additionally, analyses of the blood-brain barrier were conducted using western blotting, and neuroinflammation was assessed using ELISA. Another set of animals was evaluated on postnatal days 3, 6, 9, and 12 for neurodevelopment by observing the developmental milestones. Our results revealed hippocampal atrophy in ZIKV animals, in addition to changes in the blood-brain barrier structure and pro-inflammatory cytokines expression increase. Regarding neurodevelopment, a delay in important reflexes during the neonatal period in ZIKV animals was observed. These findings advance the understanding of the pathophysiology of CZS and contribute to enhancing the rat model of CZS."

ZIKV is a virus transmitted by arthropods (arboviruses), mainly by Aedes mosquitoes. ZIKV can also be transmitted to humans through mechanisms other than vector infection such as sexual intercourse, blood transfusions, and mother-to-child transmission. The latter mode of transmission can give rise to a severe clinical form called congenital Zika syndrome (CZS), which can result in spontaneous abortion or serious pathological alterations in the fetus such as microcephaly or neurological and orofacial anomalies. In this study, beside a succinct overview of the etiological, microbiological, and epidemiological aspects and modes of transmission of Zika virus infections, we have focused our attention on the pathogenetic and histopathological aspects in pregnancy and the pathogenetic and molecular mechanisms that can determine microcephaly, and consequently the clinical alterations, typical of the fetus and newborns, in a subject affected by CZS."

In West African countries, the African lineage was found, but there is evidence of the emergence of the Asian-American lineage in Cape Verde and Angola. This highlights the need to not only monitor ZIKV but also sequence the isolates. In this article, we present a case report of Zika fever in a pregnant woman from Guinea identified in 2018. Viral RNA was detected through qRT-PCR in a serum sample. In addition, the seroconversion of anti-Zika IgM and IgG antibodies was detected in repeated blood samples. Subsequently, the virus was isolated from the C6/36 cell line. The detected ZIKV belonged to the African lineage, the Nigerian sublineage. The strains with the closest sequences were isolated from mosquitoes in Senegal in 2011 and 2015. In addition, we conducted the serological screening of 116 blood samples collected from patients presenting to the hospital of Faranah with fevers during the period 2018-2021.

However, little is known about the neurodevelopmental consequences of maternal respiratory viral infections, which are the most prevalent infections during pregnancy. The recent COVID-19 pandemic has increased the interest in understanding the consequences of infections in offspring's development. This systematic review explores whether maternal gestational viral respiratory infections are associated with neurodevelopmental deviations in children below 10 years-old. The search was conducted in Pubmed, PsychInfo and Web of Science databases. 13 articles were revised, including information about maternal infection (Influenza, SARS-CoV-2 and unspecified respiratory infections) and offspring's neurodevelopment (global development, specific functions, temperament and behavioral/emotional aspects). Controversial results were reported regarding maternal respiratory infections during pregnancy and infants' neurodevelopment. Maternal infections seem to be associated with subtle alterations in some offspring's developmental subdomains, as early motor development, and attentional, behavioral/emotional minor problems. Further studies are needed to determine the impact of other psychosocial confounding factors."

The Zika virus (ZIKV) outbreak in Brazil has been the cause of congenital Zika syndrome (CZS), with devastating consequences such as microcephaly in newborns. Herein, we analyzed the impact of maternal overweight/obesity on the antiviral factors' expression in the placental tissue of Zika-infected mothers. We accessed placentas from women with and without obesity from 34 public health units (S\u00e3o Paulo) and from Zika-infected mothers with and without obesity from the Clinical Cohort Study of ZIKV pregnant women (Rio de Janeiro, Brazil). We first verified that obesity, without infection, did not alter the constitutive transcriptional expression of antiviral factors or IFN type I/III expression. Interestingly, obesity, when associated with ZIKV infection, showed a decreased transcriptional expression of RIG-I and IFIH1 (MDA-5 protein precursor gene). At the protein level, we also verified a decreased RIG-I and IRF-3 expression in the decidual placenta from the Zika-infected obese group, regardless of microcephaly. This finding shows, for the first time, that obesity associated with ZIKV infection leads to an impaired type I IFN downstream signaling pathway in the maternal-fetal interface."

In this review, we characterize decidual and placental immunity during maternal viral (co)-infection with HIV-1, human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), and Zika virus. We discuss placental immunology, clinical presentation, and epidemiology, before characterizing host susceptibility and cellular tropism, and how the three viruses gain access into specific placental target cells. We describe current knowledge on host-viral interactions with decidual and stromal human placental macrophages or Hofbauer cells, trophoblasts including extra villous trophoblasts, T cells, and decidual natural killer (dNK) cells. These clinically significant viral infections elicit both innate and adaptive immune responses to control replication. However, the three viruses either during mono- or co-infection (HIV-1 and HCMV) escape detection to initiate placental inflammation associated with viral transmission to the developing fetus. Aside from congenital or perinatal infection, other adverse pregnancy outcomes include preterm labor and spontaneous abortion. In addition, maternal HIV-1 and HCMV co-infection are associated with impaired fetal and infant immunity in postnatal life and poor clinical outcomes during childhood in exposed infants, even in the absence of vertical transmission of HIV-1. Given the rapidly expanding numbers of HIV-1-exposed uninfected infants and children globally, further research is urgently needed on neonatal immune programming during maternal mono-and co-infection. This review therefore includes sections on current knowledge gaps that may prompt future research directions. These gaps reflect an emerging but poorly characterized field. Their significance and potential investigation is underscored by the fact that although viral infections result in adverse consequences in both mother and developing fetus/newborn, antiviral and immunomodulatory therapies can improve clinical outcomes in the dyad."

In many cases these outbreaks have had considerable perinatal health consequences including increased risk of preterm delivery (e.g., influenza, measles, and COVID-19), and the delivery of low birth weight or small for gestational age babies (e.g., influenza, COVID-19). Furthermore, severe perinatal outcomes including perinatal and infant death are a known consequence of multiple infectious diseases (e.g., Ebola virus disease, Zika virus disease, pertussis, and measles). In addition to vaccination during pregnancy (where possible), pregnant women, are provided some level of protection from the adverse effects of infection through community-level application of evidence-based transmission-control methods. This review demonstrates that it takes almost 2 years for the perinatal impacts of an infectious disease outbreak to be reported. However, many infectious disease outbreaks between 2010 and 2020 have no associated pregnancy data reported in the scientific literature, or pregnancy data is reported in the form of case-studies only. This lack of systematic data collection and reporting has a negative impact on our understanding of these diseases and the implications they may have for pregnant women and their unborn infants. Monitoring perinatal health is an essential aspect of national and global healthcare strategies as perinatal life has a critical impact on early life mortality as well as possible effects on later life health. The unpredictable nature of emerging infections and the potential for adverse perinatal outcomes necessitate that we thoroughly assess pregnancy and perinatal health implications of disease outbreaks and their public health interventions in tandem with outbreak response efforts. Disease surveillance programs should incorporate perinatal health monitoring and health systems around the world should endeavor to continuously collect perinatal health data in order to quickly update pregnancy care protocols as needed."

ZIKV has a unique ability to use the host machinery to promote viral replication in a tissue-specific manner, resulting in characteristic pathological disorders. Recent studies have proposed that the host ubiquitin system acts as a major determinant of ZIKV tropism by providing the virus with an enhanced ability to enter new cells. In addition, ZIKV has developed mechanisms to evade the host immune response, thereby allowing the establishment of viral persistence and enhancing viral pathogenesis.

Fortunately, the development of vaccines has enabled effective defense against JE. However, re-emerging genotype V (GV) JEV poses a challenge as current vaccines are genotype III (GIII)-based and provide suboptimal protection. Given the isolation of GV JEVs from Malaysia, China, and the Republic of Korea, there is a concern about the potential for a broader outbreak. Under the hypothesis that a GV-based vaccine is necessary for effective defense against GV JEV, we developed a pentameric recombinant antigen using cholera toxin B as a scaffold and mucosal adjuvant, which was conjugated with the E protein domain III of GV by genetic fusion. This GV-based vaccine antigen induced a more effective immune response in mice against GV JEV isolates compared to GIII-based antigen and efficiently protected animals from lethal challenges. Furthermore, a bivalent vaccine approach, inoculating simultaneously with GIII- and GV-based antigens, showed protective efficacy against both GIII and GV JEVs. This strategy presents a promising avenue for comprehensive protection in regions facing the threat of diverse JEV genotypes, including both prevalent GIII and GI as well as emerging GV strains."

Consequently, increasing VLPs production is important and can be achieved by optimizing expression plasmids and cell culture conditions. While attempting to express genotype III (GIII) Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) VLPs containing the G104H mutation in the envelope (E) protein, we failed to generate VLPs in COS-1 cells. However, VLPs production was restored by cultivating plasmid-transfected cells at a lower temperature, specifically 28\u00a0\u00b0C. Furthermore, we observed that the enhancement in JEV VLPs production was independent of amino acid mutations in the E protein. The optimal condition for JEV VLPs production in plasmid-transfected COS-1 cells consisted of an initial culture at 37\u00a0\u00b0C for 6\u00a0h, followed by a shift to 28\u00a0\u00b0C (37/28\u00a0\u00b0C) for cultivation. Under 37/28\u00a0\u00b0C cultivation conditions, flavivirus VLPs production significantly increased in various mammalian cell lines regardless of whether its expression was transiently transfected or clonally selected cells. Remarkably, clonally selected cell lines expressing flavivirus VLPs consistently achieved yields exceeding 1\u00a0\u03bcg/ml. Binding affinity analyses using monoclonal antibodies revealed similar binding patterns for VLPs of genotype I (GI) JEV, GIII JEV, West Nile virus (WNV), and dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV-2) produced under both 37\u00a0\u00b0C or 37/28\u00a0\u00b0C cultivation conditions. In summary, our study demonstrated that the production of flavivirus VLPs can be significantly improved under 37/28\u00a0\u00b0C cultivation conditions without affecting the conformational structure of the E protein. KEYPOINTS: \u2022 Low-temperature culture (37/28\u00a0\u00b0C) enhances production of flavivirus VLPs. \u2022 Flavivirus VLPs consistently achieved yields exceeding 1\u00a0\u03bcg/ml. \u2022 37/28\u00a0\u00b0C cultivation did not alter the structure of flavivirus VLPs."

However, most of JEV positive reports in birds were based on molecular detection, with few viruses isolated from clinical cases. In this study, one JEV strain, designated duck/2022-SD-1, was first isolated and identified from blood samples of ducks in 2022 in Shandong province of China. The JEV duck/2022-SD-1 strain was classified into genotype I cluster and shared 96.5 to 99.5 % nucleotide sequence identity with other GI JEV strains. Biological characteristics revealed that duck/2022-SD-1 possessed similar replication ability to a virulent strain Beijing/2020-1. Based on the amino acid identity comparison of E protein, amino acid sites responsible for JEV virulence were conserved between duck/2022-SD-1 and other virulence strains. Through virulence assays in mice, we further determined that duck/2022-SD-1 was a highly virulent JEV strain with highly neuroinvasive in mice, which is similar to the virulence of another virulent strain Beijing/2020-1. Thus, the potential threat of JEV strains originating from domestic birds should be brought to people's attention."

Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), a flavivirus, is responsible for JE. In Asia, Genotype I (GI) has emerged as the dominant strain, replacing Genotype III (GIII). However, no clinically approved drug is available to treat JEV infection, and currently available commercial vaccines derived from JEV GIII strains provide only partial protection against GI. Utilizing a reverse genetics system, this study attempted to produce a novel chimeric JEV strain with high efficacy against JEV GI. Accordingly, a GI/GIII intertypic recombinant strain, namely SA14-GI env, was generated by substituting the E region of the GIII SA14-14-2 strain with that of the GI strain, K05GS. The neurovirulence of the mutant virus was significantly reduced in mice. Analysis of the immunogenicity of the chimeric virus revealed that it induced neutralizing antibodies against JEV GI in mice, and the protective efficacy of SA14-GI env was higher than that of SA14-14-2. These findings suggest that SA14-GI env may be a safe and effective live-attenuated vaccine candidate against JEV GI."

The N-terminal protease domain (180 residues) of NS3 (NS3(pro)) interacts directly with a central 40-amino acid hydrophilic domain of NS2B (NS2B(H)) to form an active serine protease. In this study, the recombinant NS2B(H)-NS3(pro) proteases were prepared in <i>E. coli</i> and used to compare the enzymatic activity between genotype I (GI) and III (GIII) NS2B-NS3 proteases. The GI NS2B(H)-NS3(pro) was able to cleave the sites at internal C, NS2A/NS2B, NS2B/NS3 and NS3/NS4A junctions that were identical to the sites proteolytically processed by GIII NS2B(H)-NS3(pro). Analysis of the enzymatic activity of recombinant NS2B(H)-NS3(pro) proteases using a model of fluorogenic peptide substrate revealed that the proteolytical processing activity of GIII NS2B(H)-NS3(pro) was significantly higher than that of GI NS2B(H)-NS3(pro). There were eight amino acid variations between GI and GIII NS2B(H)-NS3(pro), which may be responsible for the difference in enzymatic activities between GI and GIII proteases. Therefore, recombinant mutants were generated by exchanging NS2B(H) and NS3(pro) domains between GI and GIII NS2B(H)-NS3(pro) and subjected to protease activity analysis. Substitution of NS2B(H) significantly altered the protease activities, as compared to the parental NS2B(H)-NS3(pro), suggesting that NS2B(H) played an essential role in regulation of NS3(pro) protease activity. To further identify the amino acids responsible for the difference in protease activities, multiple substitution mutants including the individual and combined mutations at the variant residue 55 and 65 of NS2B(H) were generated and subjected to protease activity analysis. Replacement of NS2B-55 and NS2B-65 of GI to GIII significantly increased the enzymatic activity of GI NS2B(H)-NS3(pro) protease, whereas mutation of NS2B-55 and NS2B-65 of GIII to GI remarkably reduced the enzymatic activity of GIII NS2B(H)-NS3(pro) protease. Overall, these data demonstrated that NS2B-55 and NS2B-65 variations in hydrophilic domain of NS2B co-contributed to the difference in NS2B(H)-NS3(pro) protease activities between GI and GIII. These observations gain an insight into the role of NS2B in regulation of NS3 protease activities, which is useful for understanding the replication of JEV GI and GIII viruses."

These genotypes are the primary agents of viral encephalitis in the Asian continent. Genotypes 4 and 5 have remained silent in low-latitude tropical regions since their discovery. From 2009, the hidden genotype 5 suddenly emerged simultaneously in mosquitoes from the Tibetan region of China and those from South Korea in East Asia. The detection of genotype 5 of JEV in these mosquitoes was associated with cases of viral encephalitis in the local population. Similarly, in 2022, the long-silent genotype 4 of JEV emerged in Australia, resulting in a local outbreak of viral encephalitis that primarily affected adults and caused fatalities. The emergence and outbreaks of genotypes 4 and 5 of JEV present new challenges for the prevention and control of Japanese encephalitis (JE). This study not only analyzes the recent emergence of these new genotypes but also discusses their implications in the development of JE vaccines and laboratory tests for newly emerging JEV infections."

Patients with mCRC receiving regorafenib (n\u2009=\u2009100) were retrospectively assessed and divided into control and preexisting proteinuria (baseline grade of 1-2) groups. The primary endpoint was the development of grade\u2009\u2265\u20092 (grade\u2009\u2265\u20093 in case of baseline grade 2 patients) proteinuria. Propensity score-matching was performed to confirm the robustness of primary analyses. Defined proteinuria occurred in 30.7 and 57.9% of patients in the control and preexisting proteinuria groups, respectively, with significant differences in the all-patient population (P\u2009=\u20090.01). The preexisting proteinuria group exhibited significant defined proteinuria development within 7\u00a0days of regorafenib initiation, grade\u2009\u2265\u20093 symptoms, and treatment suspension owing to proteinuria. Similar results were obtained in the propensity score-matched population. According to multivariate logistic regression analysis, baseline proteinuria was a singular risk factor for defined proteinuria development (adjusted odds ratio; 3.76, 95% confidence interval; 1.45-9.75, P\u2009=\u20090.007).

Due to frequent and increasing use, leading to eventual excretion with body fluids, their residues have been found in hospital and household wastewaters as well as surface water. However, the effects of TKI residues in the environment on aquatic organisms are poorly described. In the present study, we investigated the cytotoxic and genotoxic effects of five selected TKIs, namely erlotinib (ERL), dasatinib (DAS), nilotinib (NIL), regorafenib (REG), and sorafenib (SOR), using the in vitro zebrafish liver cell (ZFL) model. Cytotoxicity was determined using the MTS assay and propidium iodide (PI) live/dead staining by flow cytometry. DAS, SOR, and REG decreased ZFL cell viability dose- and time-dependently, with DAS being the most cytotoxic TKI studied. ERL and NIL did not affect viability at concentrations up to their maximum solubility; however, NIL was the only TKI that significantly decreased the proportion of PI negative cells as determined by the flow cytometry. Cell cycle progression analyses showed that DAS, ERL, REG, and SOR caused the cell cycle arrest of ZFL cells in the G0/G1 phase, with a concomitant decrease of cells in the S-phase fraction. No data could be obtained for NIL due to severe DNA fragmentation. The genotoxic activity of the investigated TKIs was evaluated using comet and cytokinesis block micronucleus (CBMN) assays. The dose-dependent induction of DNA single strand breaks was induced by NIL (\u22652 \u03bcM), DAS (\u22650.006 \u03bcM), and REG (\u22650.8 \u03bcM), with DAS being the most potent. None of the TKIs studied induced micronuclei formation. These results suggest that normal non-target fish liver cells are sensitive to the TKIs studied in a concentration range similar to those previously reported for human cancer cell lines. Although the TKI concentrations that induced adverse effects in exposed ZFL cells are several orders of magnitude higher than those currently expected in the aquatic environment, the observed DNA damage and cell cycle effects suggest that residues of TKIs in the environment may pose a hazard to non-intentionally exposed organisms living in environments contaminated with TKIs."

Recently, several phenotypes and endotypes of asthma have been identified. The identification of specific subtypes of asthma is fundamental for optimizing the clinical benefit of novel treatments. Although in most patients the disease can be controlled by some combination of pharmacologic agents, in some 5-10% of patients the disease remains uncontrolled. Several monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting pathogenetic molecules (e.g., IgE, IL-5, IL- 5R\u03b1, IL-4, IL-13, TSLP) are currently available or under development for the treatment of different forms of severe type 2 asthma. The identification of diagnostic and predictive biomarkers (e.g., IgE, blood eosinophil count, FeNO, periostin, etc.) has revolutioned the field of targeted therapy in severe asthma. Monoclonal antibodies targeting Th2-driven inflammation are generally safe in adult patients with moderate-to-severe asthma. The long-term safety of these biologics is a relevant issue that should be addressed. Unfortunately, little is known about non-type 2 asthma.

Some herpesviruses persist within dividing cells, putting the viral genome at risk of being lost to the cytoplasm during mitosis because karyokinesis (nuclear division) requires nuclear envelope breakdown. Oncogenic herpesviruses (and papillomaviruses) avoid genome loss during mitosis by tethering their genomes to cellular chromosomes, thereby ensuring viral genome uptake into newly formed nuclei. These viruses use viral proteins with DNA- and chromatin-binding capabilities to physically link viral and cellular genomes together in a process called tethering. The known viral tethering proteins of human papillomavirus (E2), Epstein-Barr virus (EBNA1), and Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (LANA) each contain two independent domains required for genome tethering, one that binds sequence specifically to the viral genome and another that binds to cellular chromatin. This latter domain is called a chromatin tethering domain (CTD). The human cytomegalovirus UL123 gene encodes a CTD that is required for the virus to productively infect dividing fibroblast cells within the S phase of the cell cycle, presumably by tethering the viral genome to cellular chromosomes during mitosis. The CTD-containing UL123 gene product that supports S-phase infections is the IE19 protein. Here, we define two motifs in IE19 required for S-phase infections: an N-terminal triple lysine motif and a C-terminal nucleosome-binding motif within the CTD.IMPORTANCEThe IE19 protein encoded by human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is required for S-phase infection of dividing cells, likely because it tethers the viral genome to cellular chromosomes, thereby allowing them to survive mitosis. The mechanism through which IE19 tethers viral genomes to cellular chromosomes is not understood. For human papillomavirus, Epstein-Barr virus, and Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus, viral genome tethering is required for persistence (latency) and pathogenesis (oncogenesis). Like these viruses, HCMV also achieves latency, and it modulates the properties of glioblastoma multiforme tumors. Therefore, defining the mechanism through which IE19 tethers viral genomes to cellular chromosomes may help us understand, and ultimately combat or control, HCMV latency and oncomodulation."

Major risk factors include peculiar chewing habits, human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and molecular pathways. However, less data is available for this avertible cancer regarding its association with high-risk HPV (HR-HPV) and chewing habits in this region. Therefore, this study was done to determine the prevalence of HR-HPV in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) and its correlation with p16 and chewing habits. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) biopsy specimens of 186 samples were tested for HR-HPV type 16/18 by PCR, followed by p16 immunostaining (IHC) in a subset of cases (n = 50). Appropriate statistical tests were applied to find the association between HR-HPV/p16 and peculiar chewing habits with significance criteria of p<0.05 with 95% CI. HR-HPV (type 16 &18) was present in seven out of 186 cases (3.8%). Of these seven cases, five were positive for HPV16, whereas two were positive for HPV16/18. The overall expression of p16 protein in 50 samples was 38% (n = 19), and among these 19-IHC positive samples, 26% were positive for HR-HPV DNA. No significant association was found between HR-HPV positivity and p16 and chewing habits (p>0.05). It was concluded that HR-HPV prevalence in OSCC was very low in our population, with no statistically significant correlation with p16 and chewing habits. These results suggest the role of HR-HPV as an independent risk factor in OSCC in the local setting."

The most common aetiological factor is infection with high-risk human papilloma virus viral strains. Oxidative stress through generation of reactive oxygen species leads to lipid peroxidation and DNA damage. Studies show that reactive lipid electrophiles such as 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) produced in the process play an important role in cancer signalling pathways and are a good biomarker for oxidative stress. We aim to investigate the prognostic role of 4-HNE as a biomarker for oxidative stress in patients in early and advanced stages of CC measured by immunohistochemistry."

High-resolution anoscopy (HRA) is an in-clinic procedure to detect precancerous anal lesions and cancer, yet prospective data on factors associated with HRA attendance are lacking. We examined whether anal HPV sampling at home versus in a clinic impacts HRA uptake and assessed HRA acceptability. Methods Sexual and gender minority individuals were randomised to home-based self-sampling or clinical sampling. All were asked to attend in-clinic HRA 1year later. We regressed HRA attendance on study arm using multivariable Poisson regression and assessed HRA acceptability using \u03c7 2 tests. Results A total of 62.8% of 196 participants who engaged in screening attended HRA. Although not significant (P =0.13), a higher proportion of participants who engaged in clinic-based screening attended HRA (68.5%) compared to home-based participants (57.9%). Overall, HRA uptake was higher among participants with anal cytology history (aRR 1.40, 95% CI 1.07-1.82), and lower among participants preferring a versatile anal sex position versus insertive (aRR 0.70, 95% CI 0.53-0.91), but did not differ by race or HIV serostatus. In the clinic arm, persons living with HIV had lower HRA attendance (42.9%) versus HIV-negative participants (73.3%) (P =0.02) and Black non-Hispanic participants had lower HRA attendance (41.7%) than White non-Hispanic participants (73.1%), (P =0.04). No differences in attendance by race or HIV status were observed in the home arm. Conclusions HRA uptake differed significantly by race and HIV status in the clinic arm but not the home arm."
